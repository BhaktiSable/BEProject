Predictive policing, medical robots, smart homes and cities, artificial intelligences – we can all think about how any of those could go wrong.
Join us on this course as we explore these increasingly important topics further.","How much would you like your smart home to know about you? Has your data been harvested and used for political advertising on social media? Would you be happy to be profiled by a predictive policing AI?
As we create more data-driven technologies, those issues become increasingly urgent. We must begin to ask not only ‘what can we do?’, but also ‘what should we do?’ How should we design new technologies to make sure they are used for good, not bad purposes?
The ‘good’, the ‘bad’, and the ‘should’ are a domain of ethics, and a basis for other important concepts such as justice, fairness, rights, respect. They further inform the law and what is legal. Finally, they are at the roots of an extremely important currency in the modern economy: trust.
This story-driven course is taught by the leading experts in data science, AI, information law, science and technology studies, and responsible research and innovation, and informed by case studies supplied by the digital business frontrunners and tech companies. We will look at real-world controversies and ethical challenges to introduce and critically discuss the social, political, legal and ethical issues surrounding data-driven innovation, including those posed by big data, AI systems, and machine learning systems. We will drill down into case studies, structured around core concerns being raised by society, governments and industry, such as bias, fairness, rights, data re-use, data protection and data privacy, discrimination, transparency and accountability. Throughout the course, we will emphasise the importance of being mindful of the realities and complexities of making ethical decisions in a landscape of competing interests.
We will engage with data-based contexts such as facial recognition, predictive policing, medical screening, smart homes and cities, banking, and AI, to explore their social implications and the tools required to minimise harm, promote fairness, and safeguard and increase human autonomy and well-being. We address cutting edge issues being grappled with by practitioners and new approaches emerging in industry and offer the opportunity for participants to develop and feedback solutions.

We study out-of-memory approaches to the analysis of very large data resources, using relational databases or HDF5 as ""back ends"" with familiar R interfaces. Multiomic data integration is illustrated using a curated version of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Finally, we explore cloud-resident resources developed for the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (the ENCODE project). These address transcription factor binding, ATAC-seq, and RNA-seq with CRISPR interference.
Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.
These courses make up two Professional Certificates and are self-paced:
Data Analysis for Life Sciences:

PH525.1x: Statistics and R for the Life Sciences
PH525.2x: Introduction to Linear Models and Matrix Algebra

This is a self-paced course that continues in the development of C++ programming skills. Among the topics covered is the development of more advanced command-line programs that utilize functions, arrays, and strings to solve problems. Students learn to program in C++ through the lectures and the labs. C++ programming material is presented over eight weeks of interactive lectures with bi-weekly quizzes to assess your understanding of the material Students will experience hands-on practice writing C++ programs through twelve lab challenges.
Students will not only learn to use these more advanced procedural programming functionalities. They will also learn to analyze the computational complexity of their code. Computational complexity theory focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty and relating these classes to each other. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by the mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.
A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying their computational complexity, i.e., the number of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage.

Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.
Why Learn About Databases
Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.",0,1,1,11848,0.0,$50,English,English,Edx,Stanford University,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/7575d263-e153-4acc-b972-dfcf8edd9b0c-43dbae799606.small.png

"Agricultural Water Management: Water,-Society and Technology Interactions",https://www.edx.org/course/agricultural-water-management,"Energy & Earth Sciences, Engineering, Environmental Studies","Would you like to meet the increasing food demands around the world by contributing to optimisation of water governance and technologies? At Wageningen University & Research, the No. 1 agricultural university of the world, we approach water management from both a technical and a social perspective. Because, properly deploying water technologies for successful water management requires social and institutional agreement. Join us and learn the fundamentals of agricultural water management.","Increasingly scarce natural resources
Worldwide, a variety of processes puts more pressure on water resources every day. Global climate change causes temperatures to rise and precipitation patterns to change. A growing degree of urbanization causes people to move from the countryside to the cities. This results in increased competition over water resources, like rivers and groundwater, between cities and their surrounding areas. Furthermore, population growth and rising global welfare create an increased demand for food.
The growing demand for food must be obtained using existing agricultural land, since we are already dealing with scarcity of new farmland. Yet, the potential of increased production in the existing rain-fed agricultural areas is low.
Sustainable water management; various perspectives to consider
The combination of the processes described above create an urgent need for improved agricultural water management, agriculture being the dominant water user worldwide. In our search for sustainable solutions the management and governance regarding irrigation and drainage should take a number of water related aspects into account, among which:
• the different perspectives of involved uses and users
• including various spatial levels, from farm, to scheme, to river basin
• minding the effects on both upstream and downstream water users
• each of which must be combined with the right quantity and quality of water
Wageningen University & Research is actively involved in debates on water and food. Predominantly focussing on the combination of both water technologies and social factors, this creates a unique socio-technical approach.
Putting theory into practice
In this MOOC, we will focus on the role agricultural water management plays in this global context of sustainable water and food supplies. The online course consists of several learning modules, combined with a case study.
We start by taking a deep dive into practical and technical aspects, from crop characteristics and irrigation water requirements to actual field practices.
Subsequently, we explore the institutional perspective, from models of rural development to water management demands.
The case study videos and interviews from Morocco create the opportunity for you to directly apply your newly acquired knowledge in a real-life situation.
For whom?
This MOOC is for anyone with basic knowledge of social and biophysical sciences, ready to contribute to improving agricultural water management from where they are. Are you ready? Join us, enrol now!

Understanding Artificial Intelligence through Algorithmic Information Theory,https://www.edx.org/course/artificial-intelligence-algorithmic-information-aiai,"Computer Science, Engineering, Math","Can we characterize intelligent behavior?
Are there theoretical foundations on which Artificial Intelligence can be grounded?
This course on Algorithmic Information will offer you such a theoretical framework.

You will be able to see machine learning, reasoning, mathematics, and even human intelligence as abstract computations aiming at compressing information.
This new power of yours will not only help you understand what AI does (or can’t do!) but also serve as a guide to design AI systems.
","
Artificial Intelligence is more than just a collection of brilliant, innovative methods to solve problems. 
If you are interested in machine learning or are planning to explore it, the course will make you see artificial learning in an entirely new way. You will know how to formulate optimal hypotheses for a learning task. And you will be able to analyze learning techniques such as clustering or neural networks as just ways of compressing information.
If you are interested in reasoning , you will understand that reasoning by analogy, reasoning by induction, explaining, proving, etc. are all alike; they all amount to providing more compact descriptions of situations.
If you are interested in mathematics , you will be amazed at the fact that crucial notions such as probability and randomness can be redefined in terms of algorithmic information. You will also understand that there are theoretical limits to what artificial intelligence can do.
If you are interested in human intelligence , you will find some intriguing results in this course. Thanks to algorithmic information, notions such as unexpectedness, interest and, to a certain extent, aesthetics, can be formally defined and computed, and this may change your views on what artificial intelligence can achieve in the future.

Half a century ago, three mathematicians made the same discovery independently. They understood that the concept of information belonged to computer science; that computer science could say what information means. Algorithmic Information Theory was born.
Algorithmic Information is what is left when all redundancy has been removed. This makes sense, as redundant content cannot add any useful information. Removing redundancy to extract meaningful information is something computer scientists are good at doing.
Algorithmic information is a great conceptual tool. It describes what artificial intelligence actually does , and what it should do to make optimal choices. It also says what artificial intelligence can’t do. Algorithmic information is an essential component in the theoretical foundations of AI.

Automata Theory,https://www.edx.org/course/automata-theory,Computer Science,"This course covers the theory of automata and languages. We begin with a study of finite automata and the languages they can define (the so-called ""regular languages."" Topics include deterministic and nondeterministic automata, regular expressions, and the equivalence of these language-defining mechanisms.","We begin with a study of finite automata and the languages they can define (the so-called ""regular languages."" Topics include deterministic and nondeterministic automata, regular expressions, and the equivalence of these language-defining mechanisms. We also look at closure properties of the regular languages, e.g., the fact that the union of two regular languages is also a regular language. We consider decision properties of regular languages, e.g., the fact that there is an algorithm to tell whether or not the language defined by two finite automata are the same language. Finally, we see the pumping lemma for regular languages -- a way of proving that certain languages are not regular languages.
Our second topic is context-free grammars and their languages. We learn about parse trees and follow a pattern similar to that for finite automata: closure properties, decision properties, and a pumping lemma for context-free languages. We also introduce the pushdown automaton, whose nondeterministic version is equivalent in language-defining power to context-free grammars.
Next, we introduce the Turing machine, a kind of automaton that can define all the languages that can reasonably be said to be definable by any sort of computing device (the so-called ""recursively enumerable languages""). We shall learn how ""problems"" (mathematical questions) can be expressed as languages. That lets us define problems to be ""decidable"" if their language can be defined by a Turing machine and ""undecidable"" if not. We shall see some basic undecidable problems, for example, it is undecidable whether the intersection of two context-free languages is empty.
Last, we look at the theory of intractable problems. These are problems that, while they are decidable, have almost certainly no algorithm that runs in time less than some exponential function of the size of their input. We meet the NP-complete problems, a large class of intractable problems. This class includes many of the hard combinatorial problems that have been assumed for decades or even centuries to require exponential time, and we learn that either none or all of these problems have polynomial-time algorithms. A common example of an NP-complete problem is SAT, the question of whether a Boolean expression has a truth-assignment to its variables that makes the expression itself true.",2,2,1,8374,0.0,$129,English,English,Edx,Stanford University,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/f0e739b2-40cc-49bf-8f24-11a41b54ac16-2355c3022040.small.png

This lecture closely follows the textbook Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots by Roland Siegwart, Illah Nourbakhsh, Davide Scaramuzza, The MIT Press, second edition 2011.",1,2,1,65855,0.0,$50,English,English,Edx,ETH Zurich,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/c2750912-8e29-426f-91b8-c03b0dd9ee8f-d3ce8d3f0f02.small.jpg
Autonomous Navigation for Flying Robots,https://www.edx.org/course/autonomous-navigation-for-flying-robots,Computer Science,You will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings and how to navigate it along a trajectory.,"In recent years, flying robots such as miniature helicopters or quadrotors have received a large gain in popularity. Potential applications range from aerial filming over remote visual inspection of industrial sites to automatic 3D reconstruction of buildings. Navigating a quadrotor manually requires a skilled pilot and constant concentration. Therefore, there is a strong scientific interest to develop solutions that enable quadrotors to fly autonomously and without constant human supervision. This is a challenging research problem because the payload of a quadrotor is uttermost constrained and so both the quality of the onboard sensors and the available computing power is strongly limited. 
In this course, we will introduce the basic concepts for autonomous navigation for quadrotors. The following topics will be covered:

3D geometry,
probabilistic state estimation,
visual odometry, SLAM, 3D mapping,
linear control.

In particular, you will learn how to infer the position of the quadrotor from its sensor readings and how to navigate it along a trajectory.
The course consists of a series of weekly lecture videos that we be interleaved by interactive quizzes and hands-on programming tasks. For the flight experiments, we provide a browser-based quadrotor simulator which requires the students to write small code snippets in Python.
This course is intended for undergraduate and graduate students in computer science, electrical engineering or mechanical engineering. This course has been offered by TUM for the first time in summer term 2014 on EdX with more than 20.000 registered students of which 1400 passed examination. The MOOC is based on the previous TUM lecture “Visual Navigation for Flying Robots” which received the TUM TeachInf best lecture award in 2012 and 2013.

Becoming a Hyperledger Aries Developer,https://www.edx.org/course/becoming-a-hyperledger-aries-developer,Computer Science,"Learn how to develop blockchain-based, production-ready, decentralized identity applications using verifiable credentials with Hyperledger Aries in this free course.","Data is driving our world today. However, we hear about data breaches and identity thefts all the time. Trust on the Internet is broken, and it needs to be fixed. As such, it is imperative that we adopt a new approach to identity management, and ensure data security and user privacy through tamper-proof transactions and infrastructures.
Blockchain-based decentralized identity management is revolutionizing this space. The three Hyperledger open source projects, Aries, Indy and Ursa, provide the foundation for distributed applications built on authentic data, applications that implement the concept of “Trust over IP.” Together, the three projects provide tools, libraries, and reusable components for creating and using independent digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledgers that are interoperable across jurisdictions, applications and other data silos. While this course will cover what you need to know about Indy and Ursa, the main focus is Aries and how you can use it to quickly build your own applications on a solid digital foundation of trust. This focus will be explained further in the course but for now, rest assured: if you want to start developing decentralized identity applications rooted on the blockchain, Aries is where you need to be.
This course will get you from (pretty much) zero to developing code for issuing, holding and verifying credentials with your own production-ready Aries agents. On the way, you'll look at how Aries agents use Hyperledger Indy ledgers (you’ll even run your own ledger instances), dig into the architecture and components of an Aries agent, and learn about its underlying messaging protocols.

Building Containerized Applications on AWS,https://www.edx.org/course/building-containerized-applications-on-aws,Computer Science,Learn how to utilize container technologies and AWS services to modernize your applications,"This course introduces you to container technologies and how they can be used to modernize your applications, as well as exploring how different AWS services can be used to manage and orchestrate those containers.
Container technologies have existed for years, and are still gaining popularity. Two of the most prevalent options are Docker and Kubernetes - each with its own distinct set of features. Regardless of which technology you choose, one of the biggest challenges with containers is their orchestration. Unlike traditional, monolithic applications where you can only scale at a macro level - an executable, for example - containerized applications scale at the container level. When coupled with a microservices approach, each container can contain the code necessary to execute a single task or function. While this provides a number of benefits, a single application can consist of hundreds of containerized microservices. How do you handle starting, stopping, scaling out and scaling in all of these containers?
AWS offers a number of services that help with container orchestration, including Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Amazon Lightsail, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). Throughout this course, expert instructors will dive deep into these services as well as general container technologies and capabilities.
This course uses a combination of video-based lectures, delivered by AWS technical trainers, demonstrations, and hands-on lab exercises (Verified Learners only), to enable you to deploy and manage a containerized application.",1,1,1,0,0.0,$99,English,English,Edx,Amazon Web Services,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/2f45be03-694a-4dc3-81ed-e6a9b41c9d56-033863448f56.small.png

We will follow an API driven development process and first mock up what the API will look like. We will cover all the ins and outs of the service Amazon API Gateway, and as you’ll learn- it does a lot more than just hosting an API.
Then we will add authentication to the API using Amazon Cognito. You’ll learn about how the authorization flow works with cognito, and how to build it into your APIs. From there, we will add a Lambda backend that will be triggered by API Gateway. The lambda functions will be using the AWS SDKs to perform various data processing tasks. You’ll learn about the different configurations that exist for Lambda, and we will show you how to create and manage lambda functions.

Calculus 1C: Coordinate Systems & Infinite Series,https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-1c-coordinate-systems-infinite-series,Math,Master the calculus of curves and coordinate systems—approximate functions with polynomials and infinite series. Part 3 of 3.,"How did Newton describe the orbits of the planets? To do this, he created calculus. But he used a different coordinate system more appropriate for planetary motion. We will learn to shift our perspective to do calculus with parameterized curves and polar coordinates. And then we will dive deep into exploring the infinite to gain a deeper understanding and powerful descriptions of functions.
How does a computer make accurate computations? Absolute precision does not exist in the real world, and computers cannot handle infinitesimals or infinity. Fortunately, just as we approximate numbers using the decimal system, we can approximate functions using series of much simpler functions. These approximations provide a powerful framework for scientific computing and still give highly accurate results. They allow us to solve all sorts of engineering problems based on models of our world represented in the language of calculus.

Calculus Applied!,https://www.edx.org/course/calculus-applied,"Biology & Life Sciences, Math, Physics","Apply tools of single-variable calculus to create and analyze mathematical models used by real practitioners in social, life, and physical sciences.","In this course, we go beyond the calculus textbook, working with practitioners in social, life and physical sciences to understand how calculus and mathematical models play a role in their work.
Through a series of case studies, you’ll learn:

How standardized test makers use functions to analyze the difficulty of test questions;
How economists model interaction of price and demand using rates of change, in a historical case of subway ridership;
How an x-ray is different from a CT-scan, and what this has to do with integrals;
How biologists use differential equation models to predict when populations will experience dramatic changes, such as extinction or outbreaks;
How the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model was created to answer a biological puzzle;
How statisticians use functions to model data, like income distributions, and how integrals measure chance;
How Einstein’s Energy Equation, E=mc2 is an approximation to a more complicated equation.

With real practitioners as your guide, you’ll explore these situations in a hands-on way: looking at data and graphs, writing equations, doing calculus computations, and making educated guesses and predictions.
This course provides a unique supplement to a course in single-variable calculus. Key topics include application of derivatives, integrals and differential equations, mathematical models and parameters.
This course is for anyone who has completed or is currently taking a single-variable calculus course (differential and integral), at the high school (AP or IB) or college/university level. You will need to be familiar with the basics of derivatives, integrals, and differential equations, as well as functions involving polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms.
This is a course to learn applications of calculus to other fields, and NOT a course to learn the basics of calculus. Whether you’re a student who has just finished an introductory Calculus course or a teacher looking for more authentic examples for your classroom, there is something for you to learn here, and we hope you’ll join us!",1,1,1,82498,0.0,$139,English,English,Edx,Harvard University,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/08f162d1-6943-490b-8e0b-ee6fd5ab256e-e59757cca83d.small.jpg

However, the majority of our current scientific and industrial knowledge on conversion is based on fossil feedstock processing.
Join the MOOC Catalytic Conversions for Biobased Chemicals and Products if you want to advance your career and explore the relevant fundamental knowledge on (bio)catalytic conversionfor producing(new) biobased building blocks, chemicals and products.
The focus on this course is the design of an effective (catalytic) process for the conversions of biobased feedstocks to desired products. Unique for bioconversion is the presence of the elements O, N, P, S and large quantities of water. You will therefore will explore:

Microbial, biochemical and chemical (i.e., catalytic) conversion routes.
How to use biocatalysts, home- or heterogeneous catalysts and optimize the process of conversion. Tune catalysts to their specific advantages and disadvantages for biobased conversions.
The influence of the reactor choice as an inevitable asset in the process.
How to describe the productivity of catalytic processes depending on the choice of the reactor and how the choice of the reactor can add to the stability of the conversion process.

The knowledge gained in this course will allow you to design processes specifically targeted on biomass based conversions. Learners will also have the opportunity to interact with chemists, engineers and scientists who mainly focus on the traditional fossil-based conversions.
This course is part of the MicroMasters Program in Chemistry and Technology for Sustainability: a series of 3 courses and a final capstone project designed togive you the skills needed tocontribute toand embrace the transition from a fossil-based economy to a biobased one.

It is the official language of Mainland China and Taiwan, and one of the official languages of Singapore. The course presupposes no prior background in the language. Course objectives are to master Mandarin pronunciation, including the recognition and writing of Pinyin romanization, basic reading and writing skills, and to develop the ability to participate in simple, practical conversations on everyday topics. The relationship between Chinese language and culture and the sociolinguistically appropriate use of language will be stressed throughout. Typical lesson format will include a core conversation, vocabulary, sentence patterns, cultural notes, pattern review, quizzes, reading and various types of exercises.
The focus of this course is to train you to function successfully in Chinese culture using Mandarin as your primary language. We assume that you are interested in interacting with Chinese people in a way that will permit you to pursue professional goals in some segment of Chinese society. This means that we expect you to learn how to present yourself in a way that a Chinese person will find comfortable. If a Chinese person has to adapt to you in order to communicate, it is not likely that you can accomplish what you intend in China.
This course will help you develop skills in Mandarin Chinese to communicate and to develop an understanding of Chinese interpersonal behavioral culture and related thought patterns. At the end of the course, you will be expected to perform in speaking, listening, reading and writing Chinese at a basic level of proficiency. You should also demonstrate a level of cultural understanding suitable for correct performance of assigned tasks in Chinese (e.g., how to make a request in an appropriate way). This means that we will pay attention to the way you behave as much as we attend to your use of the language. We are really coaching you on how to behave in Chinese culture. This is a long-term process, but we will get started on it right away. In order to do this, you will have to perform. Performance, your performance , is the focus of this course.

Circuits for Beginners,https://www.edx.org/course/circuits-for-beginners,Engineering,"This course introduces DC (direct current) circuits and is typically the first course an undergraduate student in electrical engineering would take. We learn about voltage, current, and power, while building and analyzing progressively more complex circuits. We also learn about typical electrical test equipment; this course is not merely a “whiteboard-style” course, but we actually build and measure a number of real circuits.","We start from the very beginning in electronics. What is voltage? What does it physically mean? What is current? What happens in a circuit and how can things like power consumption be calculated?
In this course we learn how to analyze circuits through a variety of methods, including the Kirchoff voltage and current laws, superposition, Node Voltage Analysis, Thevenin’s Theorem and concepts such as impedance matching and maximum power transfer. These are useful to predict the performance of circuits.
We look at various types of equipment used for electrical circuit measurements, including power supplies, multimeters, oscilloscopes, and function generators. At the end of the course, students will be able to use resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, and batteries in circuits as well as analyse and design circuits containing these components.

This course introduces Cognitive Neuroscience Robotics with two approaches: the synthetic and the analytic approach. The synthetic approach means an engineering approach to understand human cognitive functions synthetically, trying to understand human cognitive functions by replicating them as artificial systems and putting them into social environments. Specifically, it develops artificial systems such as robots based on findings in neuroscience and physiology, and investigates how they could acquire intelligent behaviors through interaction with others and the environment.
On the other hand, human cognitive activities are investigated analytically. They are supported by higher functions of the brain and have been examined by psychological experiments or brain imaging. With the analytic approach, psychologists, cognitive scientists, and medical doctors are pursuing an understanding of the mechanism of the mind and its biological basis, with the help of engineering and philosophy.

In this course, we bring together computer scientists, health providers and social scientists collaborating to improve population health by analyzing and mining data routinely collected in the process of patient care.","Research has been traditionally viewed as a purely academic undertaking, especially in limited-resource healthcare systems. Clinical trials, the hallmark of medical research, are expensive to perform, and take place primarily in countries which can afford them. Around the world, the blood pressure thresholds for hypertension, or the blood sugar targets for patients with diabetes, are established based on research performed in a handful of countries. There is an implicit assumption that the findings and validity of studies carried out in the US and other Western countries generalize to patients around the world.
This course was created by members of MIT Critical Data, a global consortium that consists of healthcare practitioners, computer scientists, and engineers from academia, industry, and government, that seeks to place data and research at the front and center of healthcare operations.
Big data is proliferating in diverse forms within the healthcare field, not only because of the adoption of electronic health records, but also because of the growing use of wireless technologies for ambulatory monitoring. The world is abuzz with applications of data science in almost every field – commerce, transportation, banking, and more recently, healthcare. These breakthroughs are due to rediscovered algorithms, powerful computers to run them, and most importantly, the availability of bigger and better data to train the algorithms. This course provides an introductory survey of data science tools in healthcare through several hands-on workshops and exercises.
Who this course is aimed at
The most daunting global health issues right now are the result of interconnected crises. In this course, we highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to health data science. It is intended for front-line clinicians and public health practitioners, as well as computer scientists, engineers and social scientists, whose goal is to understand health and disease better using digital data captured in the process of care.
We highly recommend that this course be taken as part of a team consisting of clinicians and computer scientists or engineers. Learners from the healthcare sector are likely to have difficulties with the programming aspect while the computer scientists and engineers will not be familiar with the clinical context of the exercises and workshops.

Next, we move to contour integration in the complex plane and discuss vital theorems of complex analysis (such as Cauchy's and Jordan's). We complete the course with the integration of multivalued functions and introducing the concept of Riemann surfaces.","""Complex analysis"" is a practice-oriented course. Both tracks of the course (audit and verified) are supplemented with carefully chosen problems aimed at assisting the understanding of lecture materials. Each problem, in turn, is supplemented with a detailed solution.
The major concepts of complex analysis have a strong geometric flavor. Therefore, whenever possible we use geometrical interpretation of principal ideas to invoke the spatial intuition of the learner.
The majority of the topics of the course (e.g. Taylor's and Laurent's power series, Cauchy's and residue theorems) are given with immediate examples to sharpen the learner's grasp. The focal point of complex analysis is of course, the art of contour integration in the complex plane.
Building on the concept of analytic function we successively introduce the complex contour integral and main integral theorems. Gradually developing this idea we finish the course with integration along contours spanning several Riemann sheets.
The topics covered:
1. Complex numbers, complex algebra, complex derivative, analytic function, simple conformal mappings.
2. Cauchy theorem. Taylor and Laurent power series.
3. Residue theory. Contour integration. Computation of real integrals with the help of residues. Cauchy principal value integral.
4. Multivalued functions: branch points and branch cuts. The computation of regular branches.
5. Methods of analytic continuation. Analytic continuation with the help of contour deformation. Riemann surfaces of analytic functions.
6. Integrands with multivalued functions.

FAQ
What is the format of the class?
The class will consist of lecture videos, brief exercises, and homework assignments. Each of the four segments of the course will have 2-3 lectures. Each lecture includes 3-5 lecture videos, which last between 10 and 20 minutes. There will be a brief exercise after each lecture video to help you test your understanding of the material. 
Your score will be determined entirely by programming assignments for which you will receive immediate autograder feedback. You may submit your assignment to the autograder multiple times; only your last submission will count.
Programming projects are to be implemented individually without copying code from other students, largely identical online resources, or previous instances of the class. However, short of posting or sharing actual explicit code, you are encouraged to collaborate and discuss problems in the discussion forums.
Will the text of the lectures be available?
Yes. All of our lectures will have transcripts synced to the videos.
Do I need to watch the lectures live?
No. You can watch the lectures at your leisure. You can ""work ahead"" if you want to move faster than the due dates. Conversely, you can progress at a slower pace. Please note that certificates will only be awarded to students who obtain the requisite score by turning in assignments by the established deadlines.
How much does it cost to take the course?
Nothing: the course is free. If you expect to be doing a lot of graphics programming in the future, we would recommend the OpenGL and GLSL programming guides, but it is by no means required to purchase them. There are many free online resources for these topics, and we will be posting links to them.
What computer system do I need for the course?
The course material involves C++/OpenGL/GLSL programming that is portable. We provide skeleton code for all major platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux). This is a modern course involving programmable shaders, but any machine built in the last few years should be adequate. We provide many compilation hints and tips, and Homework 0 is to ensure you can compile and work with the autograder. You do need some kind of C++ development environment; we provide several resources to get you started for Homework 0. In the highly unlikely event you cannot get your machine to work, you will hopefully have adequate time to find another system.
Will I learn Maya/DirectX/3D Studio Max etc.?
This is a course on the foundations of computer graphics and covers concepts, not the intricacies of a particular software package. That said, you will be able to write complex interactive and offline 3D graphics programs at the end of the course in C++, OpenGL and GLSL.
Can I contact the Instructor or Teaching Assistants?
Yes, but not directly. The discussion forums are the appropriate venue for questions about the course. The instructors will monitor the discussion forums and try to respond to the most important questions; in many cases response from other students and peers will be adequate and faster.
I have a disability (visual/hearing etc.) Can I take the course?
In most cases, yes. We provide transcripts for all lectures. Many leading computer graphics researchers have had visual impairments like color-blindness. However, this being a computer graphics course that relies on visual image comparisons, we probably cannot provide adequate support for those who are legally blind.
I have a busy schedule this fall. Can I still take the course?
The course does require about 12 hours per week of work, and the assignments (where you are given two weeks) require the time. Certificates of achievement require a passing score. Of course, you are welcome to just go through the lectures or attempt some of the assignments if you are not interested in a certificate; we hope to provide something for everyone.",1,2,1,105430,0.0,$99,English,English,Edx,"The University of California, San Diego",https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/f6bc9b9c-e03f-4cde-b09d-bddd82dca299.small.jpg

Cyber Security Economics,https://www.edx.org/course/cyber-security-economics,"Computer Science, Economics & Finance, Social Sciences","Learn how to make better decisions about security and IT by using state-of-the-art economic tools, security metrics and data analytics.","This economics course provides an introduction to the field of cybersecurity through the lens of economic principles. Delivered by four leading research teams, it will provide you with the economic concepts, measurement approaches and data analytics to make better security and IT decisions, as well as understand the forces that shape the security decisions of other actors in the ecosystem of information goods and services.
Systems often fail because the organizations that defend them do not bear the full costs of failure. In order to solve the problems of growing vulnerability to computer hackers and increasing crime, solutions must coherently allocate responsibilities and liabilities so that the parties in a position to fix problems have an incentive to do so. This requires a technical comprehension of security threats combined with an economic perspective to uncover the strategies employed by cyber hackers, attackers and defenders.
The course covers five main areas:

Introduction to key concepts in security economics. Here, we provide an overview of how information security is shaped by economic mechanisms, such as misaligned incentives, information asymmetry, and externalities.
Measuring cybersecurity. We introduce state of the art security and IT metrics and conceptualize the characteristics of a security metric, its challenges and advantages.
Economics of information security investment. We discuss and apply different economic models that help determine the costs and benefits of security investments in network security.
Security market failures. We discuss market failures that may lead to cybersecurity investment levels that are insufficient from society’s perspective and other forms of unsafe behaviour in cyber space.
Behavioural economics for information security, policy and regulation. We discuss available economic tools to better align the incentives for cybersecurity, including better security metrics, cyber insurance/risk transfer, information sharing, and liability assignment.

After finishing this course, you will be able to apply economic analysis and data analytics to cybersecurity. You will understand the role played by incentives on the adoption and effectiveness of security mechanisms, and on the design of technical, market-based, and regulatory solutions to different security threats.

"Data, Analytics and Learning",https://www.edx.org/course/data-analytics-and-learning,Data Analysis & Statistics,An introduction to the logic and methods of analysis of data to improve teaching and learning.,"Capturing and analyzing data has changed how decisions are made and resources are allocated in businesses, journalism, government, and military and intelligence fields. Through better use of data, leaders are able to plan and enact strategies with greater clarity and confidence. Data drives increased organizational efficiency and a competitive advantage. Simply, analytics provide new insight and actionable intelligence.
In education, the use of data and analytics to improve learning is referred to as learning analytics. Analytics have not yet made the impact on education that they have made in other fields. That’s starting to change. Software companies, researchers, educators, and university leaders recognize the value of data in improving not only teaching and learning, but the entire education sector. In particular, learning analytics enables universities, schools, and corporate training departments to improve the quality of learning and overall competitiveness. Research communities such as the International Educational Data Mining Society (IEDMS) and the Society for Learning Analytics Research (SoLAR) are developing promising models for improving learner success through predictive analytics, machine learning, recommender systems (content and social), network analysis, tracking the development of concepts through social systems, discourse analysis, and intervention and support strategies. The era of data and analytics in learning is just beginning.
Data, Analytics, and Learning provides an introduction to learning analytics and how it is being deployed in various contexts in education, including to support automated intervention, to inform instructors, and to promote scientific discovery. Additionally, we will discuss tools and methods, what skills data scientists need in education, and how to protect student privacy and other rights. The course will provide a broad overview of the field, suitable for a broad audience. Learners will explore the logic of analytics, the basics of finding, cleaning, and using educational data, predictive models, text analysis, and activity graphs and social networks. We will discuss use of analytics in data domains such as log files and text data. Tableau Software is partnering with University of Texas Arlington to provide analytics software to course participants as well as technical support and guest lectures. Additional software will be introduced and discussed throughout the course.

The course does require prior knowledge of Java, object-oriented programming and linear data structures. Time complexity is threaded throughout the course within all the nonlinear data structures and algorithms.
You will explore the hierarchical data structure of trees. Trees have important properties such as shape and order which are used to categorize trees into different groups and define their functionality. The course begins by explaining Binary Trees and two subgroups: Binary Search Trees (BSTs) and Binary Heaps. You will program BSTs, their operations and traversal algorithms. BSTs are an important structure when wanting to access information quickly. Heaps approach access differently and prioritize what data is accessed. Heaps also employ the concept of up-heap and down-heap operations not found in other structures.
HashMaps and SkipLists are the last data structures discussed in the course. The HashMap ADT is a collection of key-value pairs. The key-value pairs are stored in an unordered manner based on hash codes and compression functions that translate keys into integers. You will investigate different collision strategies and implement one. SkipLists are a probabilistic data structures where data is placed in the structure based on a randomization procedure.

Investigate the balancing techniques found in both tree types. Implement these techniques in AVL operations. Explore sorting algorithms with simple iterative sorts, followed by Divide and Conquer algorithms. Use the course visualizations to understand the performance.","This Data Structures & Algorithms course completes the data structures portion presented in the sequence of courses with self-balancing AVL and (2-4) trees. It also begins the algorithm portion in the sequence of courses. A short Java review is presented on topics relevant to new data structures covered in this course. The course does require prior knowledge of Java, object-oriented programming, and linear and nonlinear data structures. Time complexity is threaded throughout the course within all the data structures and algorithms.
You will investigate and explore the two more complex data structures: AVL and (2-4) trees. Both of these data structures focus on self-balancing techniques that will ensure all operations are O(log n). AVL trees are a subgroup of BSTs and thus inherit all the properties and constraints from BSTs. Additionally, AVLs incorporate rotations that are triggered when the tree is mutated and becomes out of balance. (2-4) trees are a subgroup of B-Trees and are non-binary trees with more than 2 children. 2-4 defines the range of children that exists in the trees. However, these trees are extremely flexible and allow the nodes to shrink and grow as needed to store more data. With this flexibility comes more issues to handle, like overflow and underflow which require more intense techniques to resolve the issues.
As you enter the algorithm portion of the course, you begin with a couple of familiar iterative sorting algorithms: Bubble and Selection. There are optimizations that can be included in the standard Bubble sort to make it more adaptive in sorting. There is also a derivation of bubble sort, called Cocktail Shaker sort, that puts new a spin on the basic algorithm. Insertion sort is the last iterative sort that is investigated in this group of sort algorithms. Divide & Conquer sorting algorithms are examined and are broken into two groups: comparison sorts and non-comparison sorts. The two comparison sorts are Merge and In-place Quick sort. Both are recursive and focus on subdividing the array into smaller portions. LSD Radix sort is the non-comparison sort that deconstructs an integer number and examines the digits. All algorithms are analyzed for stability, memory storage, adaptiveness, and time complexity.

Tackle essential algorithms that traverse the graph data structure like Dijkstra’s Shortest Path. Study algorithms that construct a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) from a graph. Explore Dynamic Programming algorithms. Use the course visualization tool to understand the algorithms and their performance.,"This Data Structures & Algorithms course completes the 4-course sequence of the program with graph algorithms, dynamic programming and pattern matching solutions. A short Java review is presented on topics relevant to new data structures covered in this course. The course does require prior knowledge of Java, object-oriented programming and linear and non-linear data structures. Time complexity is threaded throughout the course within all the data structures and algorithms.
You will delve into the Graph ADT and all of its auxiliary data structures that are used to represent graphs. Understanding these representations is key to developing algorithms that traverse the entire graph. Two traversal algorithms are studied: Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search. Once a graph is traversed then it follows that you want to find the shortest path from a single vertex to all other vertices. Dijkstra’s algorithm allows you to have a deeper understanding of the Graph ADT. You will investigate the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) problem. Two important, greedy algorithms create an MST: Prim’s and Kruskal’s.
Prim’s focuses on connected graphs and uses the concept of growing a cloud of vertices. Kruskal’s approaches the MST differently and creates clusters of vertices that then form a forest.
The other half of this course examines text processing algorithms. Pattern Matching algorithms are crucial in everyday technology. You begin with the simplest of the algorithms, Brute Force, which is the easiest to implement and understand. Boyer-Moore and Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) improve efficiency by using preprocessing techniques to find the pattern. However, KMP does an exceptional job of not repeating comparisons once the pattern is shifted. The last pattern matching algorithm is Rabin-Karp which is an “out of the box” approach to the problem. Rabin-Karp uses hash codes and a “rolling hash” to find the pattern in the text. A different text processing problem is locating DNA subsequences which leads us directly to Dynamic Programming techniques. You will break down large problems into simple subproblems that may overlap, but can be solved. Longest Common Subsequence is such an algorithm that locates the subsequence through dynamic programming techniques.",1,1,1,0,0.0,$149,English,English,Edx,The Georgia Institute of Technology,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/c721c68b-6c24-4fe3-aa23-cce991d318be-0c163c304e89.small.jpeg

Why Learn About Databases
Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.",0,1,1,45597,0.0,$50,English,English,Edx,Stanford University,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/7248ea90-dad7-4b7d-b4f3-946ed6eae5e3-ce956c9963c7.small.png

Deep Learning is an extension of Machine Learning where machines can learn by experience without human intervention. It is largely influenced by the human brain in the fact that algorithms, or artificial neural networks, are able to learn from massive amounts of data and acquire skills that a human brain would. Thus, Deep learning is now able to tackle a large variety of tasks that were considered out of reach a few years ago in computer vision, signal processing, natural language processing, robotics, and sequential decision-making. Because of these recent advances, various industries are now deploying deep learning models that impact various economic sectors such as transport, health, finance, energy, as well as our daily life in general.

Traditional neural networks rely on shallow nets, composed of one input, one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layers, or so-called more depth. These kind of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures withinunlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images, sound, and text), which consitutes the vast majority of data in the world.
TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement deep learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressional, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning.

Design Thinking: Theories and Applications,https://www.edx.org/course/design-thinking-theories-and-applications,Design,Demystify design thinking as a process for problem-solving and learn how to use design thinking to solve complex and wicked problems.,"Design thinking has become very popular recently. It is because many people believe that design thinking can help generate innovative solutions. Many business and non-business organizations are adopting it to resolving their problems. Even business schools and other disciplines include design thinking in their curriculum. Then, what is design thinking, really? And how can it benefit us?
Design thinking is commonly recognized as a problem-solving process that includes five stages - Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test. However, when we compare the design thinking process with the conventional problem-solving process, there are no major differences, except the implementation part. 
Design thinking looks at problems with a holistic and human-centric perspective. It also tackles complex problems by using a non-linear approach. However, some people claim that considering design thinking as a problem-solving process is too simplistic. 
Actually, design thinking should be considered as behaviors and attitudes when dealing with problems. Design thinkers use different thinking styles and attitudes when approaching problems. Design thinkers possess certain personal traits like human-centeredness, having a flexible and creative thinking style, being comfortable with subjective and intuitive judgement, and high self-efficacy. These thinking styles and attitudes help not only in problem-solving but also in finding opportunities. In order to be proficient in design thinking, we should not only understand the design Thinking process, but also have to make ourselves become a design thinker. 
This MOOC provides you with core knowledge about design thinking and demystifies design thinking as a process for solving complex and wicked problems.",0,1,1,0,0.0,$99,English,English,Edx,The Hong Kong Polytechnic University,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/bfa9000b-ed7a-45d6-83c5-435c4596e766-9dff8935f9d8.small.jpeg

This is the first step on the path to computer engineering.","Digital systems have revolutionized our world. From television to cell phones to GPS to warfare to automobiles to medicine to distance education, computers and digital processing have reshaped the way we live and work. The semiconductor industry has grown from $21B in 1985 to $412B in 2019, making it one of the largest sectors of the economy. Computers are also a vital part of daily practice in every field of science and engineering.
Previous generations of engineers learned the “nuts and bolts” of the profession by doing hand-on projects such as disassembling and rebuilding engines. As technology has advanced, cars have become too complicated for the average person to work on. Ironically, the same advances have made computers much easier to build. While most fields of engineering require extensive mathematics and complicated analysis of even rather simple components, digital systems merely require counting from 0 to 1. Their challenge, instead, is in combining many simple building blocks into a complex whole. In this class, you will experiment with digital systems, building simple circuits from logic gates on a breadboard and designing more complex systems with a logic simulator. You will learn how to systematically create digital systems with a desired function. By the end of this course, you will have the knowledge and experience to design digital systems and be prepared for more advanced coursework.
Beyond the practical reasons to take this class, I hope you find it enormously fun and exciting like I do. There's a great satisfaction about being able to build things.

From the mobile, wearable, and smart devices of today to the transformative Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 5G powered Internet of Things (IoT) of the near future, embedded systems are the fundamental building blocks of our connected world. As we move from billions to trillions of intelligent, connected devices, it’s crucial that the next generation of engineers have a thorough understanding of how to rapidly build and deploy a modern embedded system solution.
In this course, you will learn the fundamentals of an embedded system and discover why the Arm architecture and processors are particularly well suited for IoT applications.
Our interactive labs have been designed to cover the technical fundamentals, developing in-demand skills essential for any aspiring embedded systems engineer.
You will begin by learning the characteristics of an embedded system, its components, benefits, and constraints, identify cost-performance trade-offs, and explore why the Arm architecture and processors are particularly well suited for the IoT.
You will then apply your new knowledge of digital and analog I/O, interrupts, low power features, timer and pulse width modulation to program an audio wave generator and audio player, and control peripherals along the way. 
All of this will be supported by the Mbed API – so no additional hardware is required, you can download and use the simulator right on your own computer. 
Over the six modules, you will gain a key overview of:

Embedded systems and their importance in modern computing applications
Industry-standard Arm-based microcontroller architecture, their features and programming models.

The possibilities for future IoT development and connection are enormous. In order to achieve this vision of the future, many engineers and developers will be needed to imagine and design these connected devices and the technologies they are built on.

Energy Within Environmental Constraints,https://www.edx.org/course/energy-within-environmental-constraints,"Economics & Finance, Engineering, Environmental Studies",A quantitative introduction to the energy system and its environmental impacts.,"Humanity faces an immense challenge: providing abundant energy to everyone without wrecking the planet. If we want a high-energy future while protecting the natural world for our children, we must consider the environmental consequences of energy production and use. But money matters too: energy solutions that ignore economic costs are not realistic, particularly in a world where billions of people currently can’t afford access to basic energy services. How can we proceed? 
Energy Within Environmental Constraints won’t give you the answer. Instead, we will teach you how to ask the right questions and estimate the consequences of different choices. 
This course isrich in details of real devices and light on theory. You won’t find any electrodynamics here, but you will find enough about modern commercial solar panels to estimate if they would be profitable to install in a given location. We emphasizes costs: the cascade of capital and operating costs from energy extraction all the way through end uses. We also emphasize quantitative comparisons and tradeoffs: how much more expensive is electricity from solar panels than from coal plants, and how much pollution does it prevent? Is solar power as cost-effective an environmental investment as nuclear power or energy efficiency? And how do we include considerations other than cost? 
This course is intended for a diverse audience. Whether you are a student, an activist, a policymaker, a business owner, or a concerned citizen, this course will help you start to think carefully about our current energy system and how we can improve its environmental performance.

Enroll to audit this course, and we’ll send more information about this opportunity shortly before the course begins. Communities have always wrestled with the multiple purposes of education: to train young people for careers, vocations, and college; to prepare them for their roles as citizens; to develop habits of reflective, ethical adults; and to create a common experience in a pluralistic society while meeting the needs of individual learners. As the world changes and grows more complex, returning to these important questions of purpose can help guide schools in their growth and strategic change. To ensure our schools are effective, we need to routinely reimagine what the high school graduate of the future will need to know and be able to do. The artifact that communicates these ideas is called a graduate profile. Making explicit the capabilities, competencies, knowledge, and attitudes for secondary school graduates, and inviting key stakeholders like students and community members to be engaged in the process, can help you and your school to focus your vision of success and drive school innovation efforts.Instructor Justin Reich and the course team from the MIT Teaching Systems Lab look forward to guiding teachers, administrators, community members, and others passionate about improving secondary school in the process of designing a graduate profile.

For example, what will have the greater impact on emissions: increasing public transportation use or adapting the diet? How much will emissions reduce if we phase out coal by 2025? What impact will increasing heating and cooling efficiency have on total emissions?
In this course you will be introduced to a new tool, the EUCalc Pathways Explorer, which calculates the effects of different adaptations in behavior and changes in technology. This tool consolidates scientific data gathered from researchers world-wide.
The course allows students, engineers, policy and decision makers to learn to use the tool and thereby understand the impacts, trade-offs and synergies of climate change mitigation measures in different sectors and by different lifestyles.
Scenarios can be chosen for actions in transport, diet, consumption and homes, and in technology for buildings, energy, transport and manufacturing. Effects on greenhouses gas emissions, land-use, water scarcity, jobs, air pollution and costs can be seen for each setting. This way you can consider which actions and transitions are required to mitigate climate change effects in Europe and/or its separate Member States.

After covering basic probability concepts, we move on to random variables, discrete and continuous probability distributions, sampling, estimation and central limit theorem.
An important step in ML model building is feature selection to avoid overfitting and underfitting. ML models such as regression and logistic regression use hypothesis testing to select features. We will discuss various hypothesis tests and how they are used in feature selection. 
Every ML model has an optimization stage, either to fine-tune the feature weights, or to find an optimal set of features. We will discuss important optimization techniques, and algorithms such as Gradient Descent, that play an important role in AI and ML model development.
Data must be represented in a matrix for AI and ML model development. Matrix operations such as matrix inverse and multiplication are elementary steps in model development. These fundamental concepts in linear algebra will be discussed.

Understanding how to organize and leverage the vast amounts of information at our disposal are critical skills that allow us to infer upon the world and make informed decisions. This course will introduce you to such skills. 
To work with large amounts of data, you will need to harness the power of computation through programming. This course teaches you basic programming skills for manipulating data. You will learn how to use Python to organize and manipulate data in tables, and to visualize data effectively. No prior experience with programming or Python is needed, nor is any statistics background necessary.
The examples given in the course involve real world data from diverse settings. Not all data is numerical – you will work with different types of data from a variety of domains. Though the term “data science” is relatively new, the fundamental ideas of data science are not. The course includes powerful examples that span the centuries from the Victorian era to the present day. 
This course emphasizes learning through doing: you will work on large real-world data sets through interactive assignments to apply the skills you learn.

Often, the data we have are not complete, yet we’d still like to draw inferences about the world and quantify the uncertainty in our conclusions. This is called statistical inference. In this course, you will learn the framework for statistical inference and apply them to real-world data sets.
Notably, you will learn how to conduct hypothesis testing—comparing theoretical predictions to actual data, and choosing whether to accept those predictions. You will utilize the power of computation to conduct simulations by which you can evaluate theories or hypotheses about how the world works. This course will teach you the power of statistical inference: given a random sample, how do we predict some quantity that we cannot observe directly?
You will also learn how to by quantifying the uncertainty in the conclusions you draw from hypothesis testing. This helps assess whether patterns that appear to be present in the data actually represent a true relationship in the world, or whether they might merely reflect random fluctuations due to chance. Throughout this course, we will go over multiple methods for estimation and hypothesis testing, based on simulations and the bootstrap method.

When the amount of data available is enormous, it helps if some of the analysis can be automated. Machine learning is a way of identifying patterns in data and using them to automatically make predictions or decisions. In this data science course, you will learn basic concepts and elements of machine learning. 
The two main methods of machine learning you will focus on are regression and classification. Regression is used when you seek to predict a numerical quantity. Classification is used when you try to predict a category (e.g., given information about a financial transaction, predict whether it is fraudulent or legitimate). 
For regression, you will learn how to measure the correlation between two variables and compute a best-fit line for making predictions when the underlying relationship is linear. The course will also teach you how to quantify the uncertainty in your prediction using the bootstrap method. These techniques will be motivated by a wide range of examples. 
For classification, you will learn the k-nearest neighbor classification algorithm, learn how to measure the effectiveness of your classifier, and apply it to real-world tasks including medical diagnoses and predicting genres of movies.

Fundamentals of Nanoelectronics: Basic Concepts,https://www.edx.org/course/fundamentals-of-nanoelectronics-basic-concepts,"Electronics, Engineering, Science",Presents key concepts in nanoelectronics and mesoscopic physics and relates them to the traditional view of electron flow in solids.,"The modern smartphone is enabled by a billion-plus nanotransistors, each having an active region that is barely a few hundred atoms long. Interestingly the same amazing technology has also led to a deeper understanding of the nature of current flow on an atomic scale and my aim is to make these lessons from nanoelectronics accessible to anyone in any branch of science or engineering. I will assume very little background beyond linear algebra and differential equations, although we will be discussing advanced concepts in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that should be of interest even to specialists.  
In the first half of this course (4 weeks) we will introduce a new perspective connecting the quantized conductance of short ballistic conductors to the familiar Ohm's law of long diffusive conductors, along with a brief description of the modern nanotransistor. In the second half (4 weeks) we will address fundamental conceptual issues related to the meaning of resistance on an atomic scale, the interconversion of electricity and heat, the second law of thermodynamics and the fuel value of information.  
Overall I hope to show that the lessons of nanoelectronics lead naturally to a new viewpoint, one that changes even some basic concepts we all learn in freshman physics. This unique viewpoint not only clarifies many old questions but also provides a powerful approach to new questions at the frontier of modern nanoelectronics, such as how devices can be built to control the spin of electrons.  
This course was originally offered in 2012 on nanoHUB-U and the accompanying text was subsequently published by World Scientific. I am preparing a second edition for publication in 2015, which will be used for this course. The manuscript will be made available to registered students.

Global Health Informatics to Improve Quality of Care,https://www.edx.org/course/global-health-informatics-to-improve-quality-of-ca,"Computer Science, Engineering, Medicine",Learn how to design health information and communication technology (ICT) solutions for the developing world.,"Disease has no respect for country borders and increased global travel has fueled the spread of infectious disease, as evidenced by the Ebola virus epidemic. Chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, initially confined to the developed world, now exist side by side with malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Global warming is widening the endemicity of vector-borne diseases.
In this course, we will explore ways to leverage information technology to combat disease and promote health, especially in resource-constrained settings. Technology is a driving force that sweeps across nations even faster than disease and with the spread of mobile phones, which bring computational power and data to our fingertips, new paradigms in tracking and battling disease have been discovered.
This course will explore innovations in information systems in developing countries, and focus not only on the importance of technology, but also on broader issues necessary for its success, such as quality improvement, project management, and leadership skills. Ultimately, health care delivery systems require fundamental and sound operations, such as physical infrastructure and supply-chain management, to deliver high-quality care. Technology is simply a tool to help facilitate this process.
The quality of care theme is critical to this course. The first step stakeholders in health systems should focus on prior to introducing an innovation is to establish a culture of quality improvement and patient safety. An information system can then play a facilitative role by enabling care coordination, tracking processes and outcomes, informing decision making, and fostering learning through data analysis.
An information system without an accompanying organizational transformation risks reinforcing the same failed processes. Using technology to improve access to care without any other quality improvement elements will yield the same and not necessarily better results, but more of them. Innovations need to address gaps in quality and demonstrate improvement in health outcomes, otherwise they won’t sustain or scale.
Lastly, we will discuss our attempts to leverage troves of data to define best practice and how we must keep the patient perspective and health at the center of everything we do.
This course is targeted toward individuals interested in designing or implementing a health information and communication technology (ICT) solution in the developing world.

Groundwater Contamination,https://www.edx.org/course/groundwater-contamination,"Energy & Earth Sciences, Engineering, Environmental Studies",The Earth is blue for its oceans and green for its groundwater. Access to clean freshwater is essential yet human activities deteriorate water quality. This unit describes contaminant transport in aquifers.,"Groundwater is the water beneath the ground surface. It is a vast freshwater reservoir often overlooked because invisible, yet 1000 times greater than all lakes and rivers. The Earth is blue for its oceans, but green for the freshwater under our feet. Half of the world’s population rely on groundwater for drinking. Inadequate access to safe freshwater contributes to social, economic and political instability. Human activities can affect the quality of underground freshwater. Storage tanks and sceptic systems can leak, old landfills can seep, road salts can infiltrate the ground.
This course describes the principles of transport in aquifers so that engineers can predict and plan the safe extraction of groundwater for private and public use. Engineers design the treatment of contaminated groundwater in situ or above ground; they understand how to isolate and treat a plume of using the principles of transport processes in porous media. In the United States, the Safe Drinking Water Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency to establish maximum contaminant-level goals (MCLGs) and maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for drinking water. 
How do we know how safe well-water is? How do different contaminants move through aquifers? How do we model contaminant plumes from landfills or other sources?
In this course, we will cover the following topics:
1) The Advection Dispersion Equation: The fluxes of dissolved contaminants are dictated by the mixing of water in the porous media by dispersion and its relocation by advection. We derive and describe these processes both conceptually and mathematically.
2) Methods of Solution: We describe a number of methods to help solve the differential Advection Dispersion Equation. Analytical solutions can help with heuristics, but often more practical numerical methods such as particle tracking and finite differences can help understand the behavior in more complicated, heterogenous formations. 
3) Issues with Dimensions (and Boundaries): Unlike streams and channels, aquifers cannot be modeled with one dimensional equation. We focus on two dimensional schemes that treat aquifers as plane from a top view. 
4) Notions of Reactive transport: Aquifers process nutrients and other contaminants. The fate of a chemical may be complex but is often described as a simple upscaled process. We describe the assumptions tied to the bulk behavior.
5) Applications: In this last topic, we provide examples of landfill and well contamination and walk through an example of a MODFLOW model",2,1,1,0,0.0,$750,English,English,Edx,Purdue University,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/ce24c8aa-7dbc-43a6-b7bf-8a26fd7c7dbc-c0e846700dea.small.jpeg
Groundwater Cycle,https://www.edx.org/course/groundwater-cycle,"Energy & Earth Sciences, Engineering, Environmental Studies",The Earth is blue for its oceans but green for the blankets of groundwater under our feet. This course explores the water cycle from under the ground. How much groundwater do we use and what for? How much do the trees? How do we model water fluxes?,"Groundwater is the water beneath the ground surface. It is a vast freshwater reservoir often overlooked because invisible, yet 1000 times greater than all lakes and rivers. The Earth is blue for its oceans, but it is green for the blankets of freshwater under our feet. Half of the world’s population relies on groundwater for drinking and almost half of the irrigated land now depends on groundwater, a ten-fold increase in the past 50 years. 
This course explores the water cycle from an underground perspective. We start with the description of groundwater as a resource: How much is there? Where is it? How do we use it? How much groundwater do plants and trees use every year? How much water do aquifers lose during droughts? How much do they gain during rain events or in a typical year?
In the second objective of this course, we describe underground waters and the properties and classification of aquifers. What is the difference between a confined and unconfined aquifer? What is porosity and does it influence groundwater resources? We then explain and apply Darcy’s law. Darcy is a 19th century hydraulics engineer who famously worked on bringing clean fresh water to the public fountains of Dijon, France. His law describes flow in porous media and is the cornerstone of subsurface hydrology. We will review his experiments and show how he arrived at his law empirically. We even will show in a lab video how to calculate the hydraulic properties of porous media following Darcy’s steps. After this empirical overview, we will demonstrate how we can derive the same law from first principles using Newton’s force balances. 
In our third objective, we will build up from Darcy’s law to derive the other principles of groundwater motion. What are the differences between confined and unconfined flows? What happens when it rains and the aquifers recharge? What happens in soils with inhomogeneous properties? What is a water divide? Finally, we will introduce modeling principles to translate these foundations into real-life engineering. How can we solve the equations of motion in excel using finite difference? How can we design tile drains to lower the water table in a cornfield?
This first course of our three-course series introduces groundwater cycling on Earth, from the description of stocks to fluxes and to the basics of modeling.

Human-Computer Interaction I: Fundamentals & Design Principles,https://www.edx.org/course/human-computer-interaction-i-fundamentals-design-p,Computer Science,"Learn the principles of Human-Computer Interaction to create intuitive, usable interfaces, with established design principles like feedback cycles, direct manipulation, affordances, signifiers, and more.","This course takes you through the first eight lessons of CS6750: Human-Computer Interaction as taught in the Georgia Tech Online Master of Science in Computer Science program. 
In this course, you’ll take the first steps toward being a solid HCI practitioner and researcher. You’ll learn the fundamentals of how HCI relates to fields like user experience design, user interface design, human factors engineering, and psychology. You’ll also learn how human-computer interaction has influence across application domains like healthcare and education; technology development like virtual and augmented reality; and broader ideas like context-sensitive computing and information visualization. 
You’ll then dive into the fundamentals of human-computer interaction. You’ll learn three views of the user’s role in interface design: the behaviorist ‘processor’ view, the cognitivist ‘predictor’ view, and the situationist ‘participant’ view. You’ll discover how these different views of the user’s role affect the scope we use to evaluate interaction. These perspectives will be crucial as you move forward in designing interfaces to ensure you’re considering what goes on inside the user’s head, as well as in the environment around them. 
You’ll then learn the gulfs of execution and evaluation, which determine how easily the user can accomplish their goals in a system and how well they can understand the results of their actions. All of user interface design can be seen as taking steps to bridge these gulfs. You’ll also investigate the notion of direct manipulation, which shortens the distance between the user and the objects they are manipulating in the interface. With these tools, you’ll be well-equipped to start designing effective interfaces. 
You’ll then take a deeper dive into what humans are even capable of accomplishing. You’ll learn the limitations of human sensing and memory and how we must be aware of the cognitive load we introduce on the user while using our interfaces. Cognitive load can have an enormous impact on a user’s satisfaction with an interface, and must be kept in mind as you begin your career as a designer. 
You’ll finally conclude with an overview of the major design principles in human-computer interaction. Curated from the work of Don Norman, Jakob Nielsen, Ronald Mace, Larry Constantine, and Lucy Lockwood, these design principles cover revolutionary ideas in the design of interfaces: discoverability, affordances, perceptibility, constraints, error tolerance, and more. These principles are crucial whether you move forward as a designer, an evaluator, a front-end engineer, or any other role in technology design. 
By the end of the course, you’ll have an understanding of where HCI sits in the broader field, a grasp of the goals of HCI, and a foundation in core principles that inform interface design.",0,1,1,13380,0.0,$99,English,English,Edx,The Georgia Institute of Technology,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/4d3258fc-bcee-4c37-bf7a-9f22524bf4a7-050cbdf42229.small.png
"Human-Computer Interaction II: Cognition, Context & Culture",https://www.edx.org/course/human-computer-interaction-ii-cognition-context-cu,Computer Science,"Get into the user’s mind and understand the role of mental models and representations, then investigate how to design interfaces that integrate with and influence the world around us.","This course takes you through lessons 9 through 13 of CS6750: Human-Computer Interaction as taught in the Georgia Tech Online Master of Science in Computer Science program. 
In this course, you’ll expand the scope through which you view human-computer interaction. You’ll start by going further inside the user’s mind to understand the role of mental models in guiding a user’s interaction with your system. A good user interface designer understands the mental models of their users and how representations can be used to correct those mental models. 
You’ll then learn methods for breaking down user behavior into more objective, discernible, and measurable chunks. Through the principles of task analysis and with artifacts like GOMS models, you’ll discover how to take the often-ethereal patterns of human interaction and distill them into externalizable, manipulable chunks. You’ll also learn how to use these artifacts to inform the design and improvement of interfaces. 
You’ll then widen your view to look at the context in which your interfaces are deployed. You’ll begin by learning about distributed cognition, which includes the notion that humans may offload cognitive tasks onto interfaces, and that humans and interfaces together may be considered higher-level cognitive systems. You’ll also learn about theories for investigating interaction in context, such as activity theory and situated action, and the role that human improvisation plays in any interface we design. Through these lenses, you’ll be equipped to design not just user interfaces, but user experiences developed with an understanding of the context around the interaction. 
You’ll conclude by expanding your view even further to investigate how interfaces interact with society itself: both how society guides the interfaces we create, and how the interfaces we create affect society. You’ll learn how interface design can be used to address societal issues, but also how it can have danger unintentional side effects. 
By the end of the course, you’ll have a deeper understanding of how human cognition interacts with user interfaces, and how user interfaces in turn interact with the world. You’ll be able to design interfaces that consider what the user knows and what is going on around the user.",0,1,1,0,0.0,$99,English,English,Edx,The Georgia Institute of Technology,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/7138aabb-44bc-41c1-97ec-bca2ea95f5dc-689bac28282c.small.png
"Human-Computer Interaction III: Ethics, Needfinding & Prototyping",https://www.edx.org/course/human-computer-interaction-iii-ethics-needfinding,Computer Science,"Build on your knowledge of HCI’s core principles by learning to design interfaces in the real world. Begin with the ethics of human subjects research, then learn critical methods for requirements gathering and brainstorming design alternatives.","This course takes you through lessons 14 through 18 of CS6750: Human-Computer Interaction as taught in the Georgia Tech Online Master of Science in Computer Science program. 
In this course, you’ll begin by learning the design life cycle. This is the process by which we investigate user needs, brainstorm potential designs, create prototypes, and evaluate those prototypes. This life cycle provides the structure for the third and fourth courses in this professional certificate. 
A key part of the design life cycle, however, is human subjects research. In interface design, this involves asking users for information about what they do and what they need, and then asking them for feedback on the prototypes that you develop. In HCI more broadly, this may involve testing different ideas with users to see what facilitates the best user experience. Whenever we interact with users, though, we need to keep in mind users’ rights to privacy and transparency, and so we begin this course with a discussion of ethics in HCI. This is grounded in the university Institutional Review Board process, but also investigates the role of ethics in HCI in industry as well. 
From there, you’ll move on to needfinding and requirements gathering. It is always tempting to jump straight into designing an interface based on our intuitive understanding of a task or need, but successful interface design always starts with an understanding of the users: who are they, what they do, and what they need. This involves both interacting directly with them via surveys and interviews, as well as observing them at a distance or even attempting the tasks ourselves. This concludes with an understanding of the requirements of any interface we create. 
From there, you’ll move on to brainstorming design alternatives. Again, it is often tempting to jump straight to the design we have in mind, but successful interface design starts with the results of needfinding and attempts a more grounded investigation of possible solutions. Through this lesson, you’ll learn techniques for managing effective brainstorming sessions and approaches to exploring the ideas that are created including artifacts like user personas, interaction timelines, and storyboards. 
Finally, you’ll conclude by learning about prototyping. Implementing an interface is a complicated process, and there is a risk that we may invest lots of time into an interface that is doomed to fail because we do not get user feedback on the idea. The goal of prototyping is to get an idea in front of users as quickly as possible to validate and improve it before we move on to the high pressures of implementation. 
By the end of this course, you’ll have an understanding of the design life cycle and its first three major stages: needfinding, brainstorming, and prototyping. You’ll also understand the ethical implications of HCI research and how to safeguard users’ rights.",0,1,1,0,0.0,$99,English,English,Edx,The Georgia Institute of Technology,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/8a795319-4243-4956-af0d-f23ea93d8a2a-0fd1b1cbb91a.small.png

Finally, tie principles and methods together and learn the next steps you could take in HCI.","This course takes you through the last nine lessons of CS6750: Human-Computer Interaction as taught in the Georgia Tech Online Master of Science in Computer Science program. 
In this final course in the professional certificate, you’ll complete your understanding of the design life cycle, and learn about the modern relevance of human-computer interaction. 
You’ll begin by learning about evaluation. This is the critical final step of the design life cycle, where we put our prototypes in front of real users (or strong approximations thereof) to get feedback on their quality. You’ll learn about three methods for evaluation: first, qualitative evaluation lets you get direct feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of your interface from real users. Second, quantitative evaluation lets you make strong claims about the effectiveness of your interface or the validity of your theories of interaction. Third, heuristic evaluation lets you inject evaluation much more completely into the design process, persistently putting yourself into the mindset of a user to investigate an interface. 
Then, you’ll learn how human-computer interaction relates to a modern trend in software development, Agile design. HCI and Agile development have a deep symbiosis in the way they each value rapid feedback. Moreover, modern technologies have allowed high-fidelity prototypes to be developed with the relative ease of low-fidelity prototypes in the past, allowing even better feedback and evaluation to come in throughout the design process. 
After wrapping up your understanding of the design life cycle and its iterative nature, you’ll turn your attention to a deeper dive into the modern state of human-computer interaction. You’ll have the chance to explore cutting-edge research in HCI, from technologies like extended reality to domains like cybersecurity to ideas like gesture-based interaction. HCI is a dynamic and evolving field, and any education it would not be complete without a chance to look at what’s happening today. 
Finally, you’ll conclude by looking at how far you’ve come and what you could do next. From other MOOCs to graduate degrees in the field, there are enormous possibilities for further studies in HCI. 
By the end of this course, you’ll have an understanding of the importance of evaluation in the design life cycle, as well as an understanding of where HCI sits in modern development and research.",0,1,1,0,0.0,$99,English,English,Edx,The Georgia Institute of Technology,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/d72cb271-b1ed-4881-bc87-dbcc16708307-b03f50bdd766.small.png

"I ""Heart"" Stats: Learning to Love Statistics",https://www.edx.org/course/i-heart-stats-learning-to-love-statistics,"Data Analysis & Statistics, Math, Social Sciences","Is your relationship with statistics dysfunctional? We can help: Get to know stats, build a healthy bond, and maybe even fall in love!","When you meet a new person, it is hard to know what to expect. You may not be able to read the person or understand what they mean. Even if you want to have a good relationship with them, this lack of understanding can make interactions tense, unpredictable and scary! The same is true for a lot of people as they encounter statistics and mathematical ways of working with data. Statistics can be confusing and opaque. Symbols, Greek letters, very large and very small numbers, and how to interpret all of this can leave to feeling cold and disengaged—even fearful and resentful.
But in the modern information age, having a healthy relationship with statistics can make life a whole lot easier. We are constantly faced with an onslaught of data and claims about it—from news articles, to Facebook and blog posts, casual and professional conversations, reports at our workplace, advertising, and claims from politicians and public officials. How can we process that information, make sense of it, evaluate truth claims, and put ourselves in a position to act on the information? One of the most important ways is by befriending statistics and consistently using statistical ways of thinking. 
The purpose of this course, then is to help you develop a functional, satisfying, and useful life-long relationship with statistics. To achieve that goal, we will take a non-technical approach—you will learn how statistics work and why they are so helpful in evaluating the world of information that is around us. You will learn about the logic of statistical thinking and the concepts (rather than the mathematical details and probability theory) that guide statistical inferences and conclusions. 
You do not need to be a math whiz to take this course. If you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide (or just be able to use a calculator to do that!), you will be more than able to handle what will happen as this relationship develops. 
By the end of the course you will be able to:

Identify the most important features of a data set
Select a statistical test based on the features of the data
Think like a statistical detective
Understand the relationship between two different characteristics or variables
Perform some simple statistical calculations and draw some conclusions from real data
Hopefully, love stats!

Issues of energy poverty and energy injustice are encountered in all societies.
This course will focus on how can we can tackle those challenges and accomplish an Inclusive Energy System, in which energy services are recognized as a social right for every citizen. We will use a socio-technical systems approach to the energy system. By examining the system from various value perspectives we will discover new solutions for the inclusive provision of energy services beyond the purely technological solutions.
Our starting points for this course are the four A’s. These represent the main values of the energy system: Accessibility, Availability, Affordability, and Acceptability of energy services. Balancing these four critical and interdependent values is a recurrent challenge for every society, as the meaning of the four A’s evolves with economic development and changing societal preferences.
In this course you will be introduced to the challenges created by the evolution of the energy system and the values we expect it to uphold. How can we measure the four A’s? What are the trade-offs? How does the governance of the energy system impact those trade-offs? And how does it impact the nexus between water, food and energy? How can the institutional framework (e.g. laws, regulation, market design) be tweaked or redesigned to ensure a more inclusive energy system, aligned with principles of distributive and procedural justice?
Case studies from developed and developing countries will help you to develop and test your analytical skills. Interviews with industry leaders shaping the energy system will help you reflect on the position these leaders take and the interests they serve.
Lastly, you will put yourself to the test by demonstrating your newly acquired knowledge and skills by taking the role of a strategic policy advisor. You will be challenged to advise the strategic decision makers of your company, your city or your country on the policy interventions they should pursue to bring a more inclusive energy system into being.

The course covers IT disciplines including systems and services, network and security, scripting and programming, data management, and the business of IT. The course also surveys technologies within these disciplines.","Information technology (IT) can be viewed as a system, a combination of independent parts all working together to accomplish a certain goal. Systems are everywhere. For example, the respiratory, circulatory, nervous, and other subsystems of the body work together towards the common goal of keeping humans alive. IT is similar in that it consists of various subsystems all working towards a common goal. Information Technology Foundations will examine how the system called IT helps an organization advance its business goals and vision, resulting in improved growth, profits, and productivity.
The course will explore the different components of IT and how they work together as a system to support the different aspects of an organization. Specifically, the course will explore different categories of software such as operating systems, programming, and databases. The hardware components that will be examined are the structure of computers and their peripherals. The role of people will be an important focus of the course, describing which roles are necessary for the IT system to function efficiently and effectively. This focus includes the various administrative roles, the methodologies used by people tasked with developing new systems, and the ethical issues that must be considered by individuals involved with IT. In IT, as with many other systems, the independent parts must be integrated together to reach the common goal. This integration is accomplished by networking, which encompasses the core components of hardware, software, and users. IT supports and improves many aspects of an organization, including communication (both internal and external), resource sharing, cross-department integration, information management, security of organization and employee information, and organization adherence to ethical practices.

If yes, this is the right course for you to start!
“Big data”, “data science”, “data-mining” and “artificial intelligence” are all popular terms that are often encountered nowadays in the academic and in business worlds.
Computer Science is a field where the usage of computers and “computations” have continuously evolved. As computational power increases, computation becomes an indispensable tool for solving complex problems and making predictions. We are now able to “compute” various things from DNA sequencing to aerodynamics simulations and weather forecasting.
In this course, you will learn the essence of computer science. You will obtain an overview of cutting-edge computer science as well as learn the basics and introductory level knowledge of computer science, while experiencing, designing and writing your own simple programs. The video lectures in this course are delivered in English accompanied by English transcripts. This English version comprised of 5 units is the revised original Japanese course previously released with same topic.
We will start by learning more about the notion of computation and data and see how things work inside a computer. Before jumping into advanced topics like encryption and cryptanalysis, we will discover important notions like ""arrays"", ""characters"" and ""strings"" and we will know more about functions and subroutines throughout the lectures. Along the way we will practice with exercises to have a hands-on experience and deeper understanding of the explained notions. All exercises have files that can be downloaded and used. A detailed explanation about setting up the environment to run the programs using the language Ruby is provided at the beginning of the course.

The core structure of this course is organized around the three basic principles of DevOps, otherwise known as the “Three Ways”. The “Three Ways” outline the values and philosophies that guide DevOps processes and practices:

The First Way - This is a set of principles and practices that accelerate the delivery of IT services. Much of the material covered in this section will focus on Continuous Delivery and the extended principles and practices that lead to an accelerated flow.
The Second Way - This is a set of principles and practices that amplify feedback loops. In this section we will cover the concepts of creating a problem solving culture , as well as understanding monitoring , as it applies to DevOps. A significant portion of this section will also include monitoring business metrics, and will also explain how change management applies to DevOps.
The Third Way - The patterns discussed in this section cover the concepts of organizational learning and safety culture. Items like blameless postmortems, resilience engineering, and systems thinking as they apply to DevOps will be covered in this course.

The goal of this course is to cover an extensive study of all of the DevOps principles and practices known to date, such that you can create transformative DevOps initiatives with incredible outcomes. This course also sets up the foundation for implementing the tools and technology that will be needed for further success and execution of a DevOps transformation. 
If you are a manager or a practitioner looking for guidelines on how to start transforming organizations, this course is for you. Upon completion, you should have a good understanding of the foundation, principles, and practices of DevOps. You should be able to continue your progress for an organizational transformation using the acquired skills set.",0,2,1,0,0.0,$99,English,English,Edx,The Linux Foundation,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/c71e5b58-c711-4bb9-bcc6-162774a463d1-31791a579b9f.small.jpg
Introduction to Differential Equations,https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-differential-equations-2,Math,Scientists and engineers understand the world through differential equations. You can too.,"How do you design:

A boat that doesn’t tip over as it bobs in the water?
The suspension system of a car for a smooth ride?
Circuits that tune to the correct frequencies in a cell phone?

How do you model:

The growth of antibiotic resistant bacteria?
Gene expression?
Online purchasing trends?

The answer: Differential Equations.
Differential equations are the language of the models we use to describe the world around us. In this mathematics course, we will explore temperature, spring systems, circuits, population growth, and biological cell motion to illustrate how differential equations can be used to model nearly everything in the world around us.
We will develop the mathematical tools needed to solve linear differential equations. In the case of nonlinear differential equations, we will employ graphical methods and approximation to understand solutions.

Introduction to Digital Humanities,https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-digital-humanities,"Computer Science, Humanities",Develop skills in digital research and visualization techniques across subjects and fields within the humanities.,"As primary sources of information are more frequently digitized and available online than ever before, how can we use those sources to ask new questions? How did Chinese families organize themselves and their landscapes in China’s past? How did African slaves from different cultures form communities in the Americas? What influences informed the creation and evolution of Broadway musicals? How can I understand or interpret 1,000 books all at once? How can I create a visualization that my students can interact with? The answers to these questions can be explored using a wide variety of digital tools, methods, and sources. 
As museums, libraries, archives and other institutions have digitized collections and artifacts, new tools and standards have been developed that turn those materials into machine-readable data. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI), for example, have enabled humanities researchers to processvastamounts of textual data. However, these advances are not limited just to text. Sound, images, and video have all been subject to these new forms of research.

Introduction to Functional Programming,https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-functional-programming,"Computer Science, Engineering",The aim of this course is to teach the foundations of functional programming and how to apply them in the real world.,"Broadly speaking, functional programming is a style of programming in which the primary method of computation is the application of functions to arguments. Among other features, functional languages offer a compact notation for writing programs, powerful abstraction methods for structuring programs, and a simple mathematical basis that supports reasoning about programs.
Functional languages represent the leading edge of programming language design, and the primary setting in which new programming concepts are introduced and studied. All contemporary programming languages such as Hack/PHP, C#, Visual Basic, F#, C++, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Racket, … support higher-order programming via the concept of closures or lambda expressions.
This course will use Haskell as the medium for understanding the basic principles of functional programming. While the specific language isn't all that important, Haskell is a pure functional language so it is entirely appropriate for learning the essential ingredients of programming using mathematical functions. It is also a relatively small language, and hence it should be easy for you to get up to speed with Haskell.
Once you understand the Why, What and How that underlies pure functional programming and learned to “think like a fundamentalist”, we will apply the concepts of functional programming to “code like a hacker” in mainstream programming languages, using Facebook’s novel Hack language as our main example. This course assumes no prior knowledge of functional programming, but assumes you have at least one year of programming experience in a regular programming language such as Java, .NET, Javascript or PHP.

If the system also requires high performance (e.g. an industrial robot, a car, or an aircraft), the usual approach is to use a state-space feedback controller derived from a physics-based model. And when performance is less critical (e.g. for toys and appliances), the traditional choice has been to tune a low-cost proportional-derivative-integral (PID) controller.
Over the last few years, much has changed. The dramatic decline in the cost of accurate sensors and fast microcontrollers have made state-space controllers practical even for inexpensive toys. In addition, modeling approaches have become far more reliant on measurement and computation rather than physics and analysis. In this course, we examine the theory and application of this arc of alternatives to control, starting with PID, then moving to physical-modeling and state-space, and ending with state-space using measurement-based modeling. In each case, you will design and test controllers with your own copter-levitated arm, to solidify your understanding and to gain insight in to the practical issues.

Introduction to Statistics: Inference,https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-statistics-inference-5,"Data Analysis & Statistics, Math",An introduction to statistical ideas and methods commonly used to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples.,"Statistics 2 at Berkeley is an introductory class taken by about 1,000 students each year. Stat2.3x is the last in a sequence of three courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley's Stat 2. The focus of Stat2.3x is on statistical inference: how to make valid conclusions based on data from random samples. At the heart of the main problem addressed by the course will be a population (which you can imagine for now as a set of people) connected with which there is a numerical quantity of interest (which you can imagine for now as the average number of MOOCs the people have taken). If you could talk to each member of the population, you could calculate that number exactly. But what if the population is so large that your resources will not stretch to interviewing every member? What if you can only reach a subset of the population?
Stat 2.3x will discuss good ways to select the subset (yes, at random); how to estimate the numerical quantity of interest, based on what you see in your sample; and ways to test hypotheses about numerical or probabilistic aspects of the problem.
The methods that will be covered are among the most commonly used of all statistical techniques. If you have ever read an article that claimed, ""The margin of error in such surveys is about three percentage points,"" or, ""Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have discovered a highly significant link between ...,"" then you should expect that by the end of Stat 2.3x you will have a pretty good idea of what that means. Examples will range all the way from a little girl's school science project (seriously – she did a great job and her results were published in a major journal) to rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Stat2.2x is the second of three five-week courses that make up Stat2x, the online equivalent of Berkeley's Stat 2.
The focus of Stat2.2x is on probability theory: exactly what is a random sample, and how does randomness work? If you buy 10 lottery tickets instead of 1, does your chance of winning go up by a factor of 10? What is the law of averages? How can polls make accurate predictions based on data from small fractions of the population? What should you expect to happen ""just by chance""? These are some of the questions we will address in the course.
We will start with exact calculations of chances when the experiments are small enough that exact calculations are feasible and interesting. Then we will step back from all the details and try to identify features of large random samples that will help us approximate probabilities that are hard to compute exactly. We will study sums and averages of large random samples, discuss the factors that affect their accuracy, and use the normal approximation for their probability distributions.

Introduction to User Experience,https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-user-experience-3,"Computer Science, Design, Engineering","This MOOC will review the fundamental elements UX practice (e.g., UX project, key concepts, activities, roles, deliverables).
From application software to mobile application and website, get an introduction on how to design professional interfaces offering quality experiences.","The user experience is defined as the result of the internal states (eg expectations, predispositions) of a user, the characteristics of a system (eg complexity, usability) and the context of use of the interaction between the user and the system (eg in organization, in private).
Organizations value innovative and well-designed user experiences for their customers and employees, whether they are using their websites, mobile applications, self-service kiosks in store, or various internal interfaces. The practice of UX design uses the user-centered approach and covers 3 main activities: UX research (getting to know the users and their contexts), activities surrounding ideation (such as ""design thinking"" and participatory design) and prototyping. This course teaches methods, techniques and digital tools specific to UX in today's business context.
A UX professional is able to intervene in the design process of a digital product or service in order to ensure a user-centered approach. This allows the organization to respond to the expectations of its users. A UX professional mobilizes a range of interview and observation methodologies until the development of a prototyped interface.
UXPA defines user experience professionals as specialists involved in research, design and evaluation of products and services. Conceptually, this notion of user experience emerges from the human-centered design approach in the field of human machine interaction and human factors in industrial engineering.
Research corresponds to the activity of learning about user interfaces and the context in which they will be used.
Evaluation corresponds to user observation when using these interfaces, as much before, during and after the design and development of the product.
Design corresponds to the standards and principles of design of digital products or services offering optimal user experiences.
Overall objective of the MOOC:
Discuss what the user experience is in the context of business practice",1,1,1,10693,0.0,$200,English,English,Edx,HEC Montréal,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/21e97f78-3f87-4874-856e-3c13ec9680cd-f65f4b8e725f.small.jpeg

Irrigation water uses 70% of the fresh water extraction worldwide to produce 40% of the food. 
Arid countries are dependent on these cropproduction systems but irrigation is usually operated at low efficiency. There is great potential to increase food output per drop of water from field through farm up to catchment level. 
In this intermediate course you will learn about the irrigation supply chain, from water sources to root zone. First, you’ll learn to calculate the amount of water plants need to produce a healthy and plentiful crop. You will then see how this water is supplied to the roots and how it getsto the field from the source. 
We’ll see how efficiency influences the design and operation of both the water application and conveyance components of irrigation systems. Towards the end we will explore a number of real-world systems including drip irrigation and surface irrigation. Together with experts in irrigation we will see different perspectives on efficiency. 
As you progress through the course, you will understand the drivers of irrigation efficiency for irrigators, water users and communities. This will allow you to see efficiency at the scale of the entire water resource, taking a more holistic view of water flows, water losses and possible water savings.

Will it give the right output for all possible permitted inputs? Computers are now essential in everyday life. Incorrect programs lead to frustration in the best case and disaster in the worst. Thus, knowing how to construct correct programs is a skill that all who program computers must strive to master.
In this computer science course, we will present ""goal oriented programming"" the way Edsger Dijkstra, one of the most influential computer scientists, intended. You will learn how to derive programs hand-in-hand with their proofs of correctness. The course presents a methodology that illustrates goal-oriented programming, starting with the formalization of what is to be computed, and then growing the program hand-in-hand with its proof of correctness. The methodology demonstrates that, for a broad class of matrix operations, the development, implementation, and establishment of correctness of a program can be made systematic.
Since this technique focuses on program specifications, it often leads to clearer, correct programs in less time. The approach rapidly yields a family of algorithms from which you can then pick the algorithm that has desirable properties, such as attaining better performance on a given architecture.
The audience of this MOOC extends beyond students and scholars interested in the domains of linear algebra algorithms and scientific computing. This course shows how to make the formal derivation of algorithms practical and will leave you pondering how our results might extend to other domains.

LAFF-On Programming for High Performance,https://www.edx.org/course/laff-on-programming-for-high-performance,Computer Science,Learn to squeeze high performance out of modern CPUs.,"Is my code fast? Can it be faster? Scientific computing, machine learning, and data science are about solving problems that are compute intensive. Choosing the right algorithm, extracting parallelism at various levels, and amortizing the cost of data movement are vital to achieving scalable speedup and high performance. 
In this course, the simple but important example of matrix-matrix multiplication is used to illustrate fundamental techniques for attaining high-performance on modern CPUs. A carefully designed and scaffolded sequence of exercises leads the learner from a naive implementation to one that effectively utilizes instruction level parallelism and culminates in a high-performance multithreaded implementation. Along the way, it is discovered that careful attention to data movement is key to efficient computing. 
Prerequisites for this course are a basic understanding of matrix computations (roughly equivalent toWeeks 1-5 of Linear Algebra: Foundations to Frontiers on edX) and an exposure to programming.

"Language, Proof and Logic",https://www.edx.org/course/language-proof-and-logic,Language,"The ability to reason is fundamental to human beings.

The consequences of incorrect reasoning can be minor, like getting lost on the way to a birthday party, or more significant, for example launching nuclear missiles at a flock of ducks, or permanently losing contact with a space craft.
The fundamental question that we will address in this course is ""when does one statement necessarily follow from another"" --- or in the terminology of the course, ""when is one statement a logical consequence of another"". This is an issue of some importance, since an answer to the question would allow us to examine an argument presented in a blog, for example, and to decide whether it really demonstrates the truth of the conclusion of the argument. Our own reasoning might also improve, since we would also be able to analyze our own arguments to see whether they really do demonstrate their conclusions.","In this course you will be introduced to the concepts and techniques used in logic.

It covers the same syllabus topics as the Advanced Placement Mechanics-C course.,"Mechanics ReView is a second look at introductory Newtonian Mechanics. It will give you a unified overview of mechanics that will dramatically increase your problem-solving ability. It is open to all students who meet the prerequisites (see right), but is especially designed for teachers and students who want to improve their existing understanding of mechanics.
Newtonian mechanics is the study of how forces change the motion of objects. This course begins with force, and moves on to straight-line motion, momentum, mechanical energy, rotational motion, angular momentum, and harmonic oscillators. Optional units include planetary orbits and a unit whose problems require multiple concepts to be applied to obtain one solution.
NOTE: New Section “Problem-solving Pedagogy”
We have developed a special approach to organizing the physics content knowledge and for applying it when solving problems. This approach is called “Modeling Applied to Problem Solving” and has been researched carefully and has proven effectiveness for improving students’ performance in a later physics course on Electricity and Magnetism.
If you are a teacher looking to improve your knowledge of mechanics, or to learn new approaches to teach your students, we encourage you to sign up in the special teacher section featuring a discussion forum for teachers to discuss teaching ideas and techniques related to the topics discussed in this course. To join these discussions, verify yourself as a teacher, and we will sign you up in the teacher forum.
Note that this forum is exclusively reserved for teachers, so please do not register if you are not a teacher.
Teachers in the United States, and especially in Massachusetts, can receive extra benefit from this course. We offer Professional Development Points (PDPs) at no charge to teachers in Massachusetts who complete our course. If you are in a different state, we instead offer Continuing Education Units through the American Association of Physics Teachers. There is a fee for this certificate.
Course Syllabus
Note: Taking this Course Involves Using Some Experimental Materials
The RELATE group that authors and administers this course is an education research group, dedicated to understanding and improving education, especially online. We showed that 8.MReV generated slightly more conceptual learning than a conventionally taught on-campus course - but we were unable to find exactly what caused this learning. (So far this is the only published measurement of learning in a MOOC). This summer we will be comparing learning from different types of online activities that will be administerered to randomly assigned sub-groups of our students. At certain points in the course, new vs. previously used sequences of activities will be assigned to different groups. We will then use common questions to compare the amount learned. Which group receives the new activities will be switched so that neither group will have all new activities.
Our experimental protocol has been approved by the MIT Committee on Use of Human Subjects. As part of this approval we have the obligation to inform you about these experiments and to assure you that:

We will not divulge any information about you that may be identified as yours personally (e.g. a discussion post showing your user name). 
The grade for obtaining a certificate will be adjusted downwards (from 60%) to compensate if one group has harder materials.

Note: By clicking on the registration button, you indicate that you understand that everyone who participates in this course is randomly assigned to one of the groups described above. 
Welcome, and we hope you will both learn from and enjoy this course.

FAQs
Is there a required textbook?
You do not need to buy a textbook. All material is included in this edX course and is viewable online. If you would like to use a textbook with the course (for example, as a reference), most calculus-level books are suitable. Introductory physics books by Young and Freedman, Halliday and Resnick, or Knight are all appropriate (and older editions are fine).
What if I take a vacation?
The course schedule is designed with this in mind! Course contents are released four weeks ahead of the deadline, so even if you have a four-week vacation, you do not need to miss any deadlines and can still complete all of the material.
Will I get a certficiate?
Yes! This course awards certificates to all who satisfactorily complete the required portion of the course.
How are grades assigned?
There are three parts of the course that are worth points: Checkpoint problems that are folded in with the reading, Homework problems that come at the end of each unit, and Quizzes that are at the end of every 1-2 units. Each is worth a varying number of points, and you will not have to do every problem.
The course consists of 11 required units and three optional units. You do not need to complete the optional units in order to receive a certificate.

Modeling and Simulation of Multibody Systems - Part I,https://www.edx.org/course/modeling-and-simulation-of-multibody-systems-part-i,"Engineering, Physics","Vehicles, bicycles, cranes, human body and robots are multibody systems. Learn how to model them and compute their kinematic and dynamic characteristics, such as velocities, accelerations and forces.","This course aims at acquainting you with the modeling and simulation of complex articulated mechanical systems, denoted as multibody systems, such as vehicles, merry-go-rounds, motorbikes, cranes, human bodies, suspensions, robot manipulators, mechanical transmissions, etc.
This course is based on (1) video clips focusing on the main theoretical background and concepts, (2) well-illustrated written sections giving more details about the mathematical formulation, and (3) questions, exercises and modeling projects.
Despite the intrinsic complexity of such systems in terms of morphology and motions, basic skills in Newtonian mechanics, linear algebra and numerical methods are sufficient to model them, provided that the endless and tedious computation related to their internal kinematics and dynamics are at our disposal. This is the purpose of the symbolic program ROBOTRAN*, which can be used with this course and can automatically generate the full set of equations of motion of MBS, in a symbolic manner, i.e. exactly as if you were writing them by hand, whatever the size and the morphological complexity of the application. Hence, this course will instead teach you how to intervene upstream and downstream this generation step.
Upstream the latter, you will learn how to translate a real system, e.g. a car suspension, into a virtual multibody model comprising bodies, joints, internal or external forces and torques and imposed motion… with a level of refinement that will be dictated by the original issue. For example, what is the minimum tire ground force when the car suspension is excited by a shaker?
Downstream the symbolic generation, your intervention will consist in:

Completing the symbolic model with features that are specific to your system, e.g. a tire force model or the tuning of a motion controller, among other things;
Implementing under the form of a program (in Python, Matlab, or C) a time simulation to solve the differential equations of motion, given the original question: e.g. find the transient motion of the system submitted to forces and torques and compute a specific force time history or the maximal acceleration of a particular point.
Selecting the most suitable results, including self-explanatory - and sometimes funny - video animations of your multibody system in motion.

In sum, this course, based on the use of the ROBOTRAN* symbolic generator, will allow you to focus on the most interesting aspects of the multibody modeling process, by entirely mastering your computer model from the input data to the results, instead of using a black-box multibody software that clearly goes against the educational objective of this course. 
Enjoy Multibody Dynamics! 
*Note: The course was built to teach modeling and simulation of multibody systems, and not to teach any specific software. However, we suggest that you use the symbolic ROBOTRAN program to model and study the various multibody systems proposed in this course.",2,2,1,0,0.0,$139,English,English,Edx,Université catholique de Louvain,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/50a0c43a-8f59-441e-9fd4-d9658627f624-d285aff40d31.small.jpeg

""Databases"" was one of Stanford's three inaugural massive open online courses in the fall of 2011. It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. 
Relational Databases and SQL is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.
All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.
Why Learn About Databases
Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.",0,1,1,7559,0.0,$50,English,English,Edx,Stanford University,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/2c192210-3267-44e4-badf-032012d3c241-2f65473c9f97.small.png

Nanotechnology: Fundamentals of Nanotransistors,https://www.edx.org/course/nanotechnology-fundamentals-of-nanotransistors,"Electronics, Engineering, Physics",Explore nanotechnology and gain an understanding of the essential physics and technology of nanotransistors.,"The transistor has been called the greatest invention of the 20th century – it enables the electronics systems that have shaped the world we live in. Today’s nanotransistors are a high volume, high impact success of the nanotechnology revolution. If you are interested in understanding how this scientifically interesting and technologically important nano-device operates, this course is for you!
This nanotechnology course provides a simple, conceptual framework for understanding the essential physics of nanoscale transistors. It assumes only a basic background in semiconductor physics and provides an opportunity to learn how some of the fascinating new discoveries about the flow of electrons at the nanoscale plays out in the context of a practical device.
The course is divided into four units:

Transistors fundamentals
Transistor electrostatics
Ballistic MOSFETs
Transmission theory of the MOSFET

The first two units provide an introduction for students with no background in transistors or a quick review for those familiar with transistors. The third unit treats the ballistic transistor in which electrons move without resistance (in the traditional sense). The last unit uses that Landauer Approach to electron transport, which was developed to understand some striking experiments in nanophysics, to develop an understanding of how electrons flow in modern nanotransistors. This short course describes a way of understanding MOSFETs that is much more suitable than traditional approaches when the channel lengths are of nanoscale dimensions. Surprisingly, the final result looks much like the traditional, textbook, MOSFET model, but the parameters in the equations have simple, clear interpretations at the nanoscale.
My objective for this course is to provide students with an understanding of the essential physics of nanoscale transistors as well as some of the practical technological considerations and fundamental limits. The goal is to do this in a way that is broadly accessible to students with only a very basic knowledge of semiconductor physics and electronic circuits. The course is designed for anyone seeking a sound, physical, but simple understanding of how nanoscale transistors operate. The course should be useful for advanced undergraduates, beginning graduate students, as well as researchers and practicing engineers and scientists.
This course is the latest in a series offered by the nanoHUB-U project which is jointly funded by Purdue and NSF with the goal of transcending disciplines through short courses accessible to students in any branch of science or engineering.

The On-Line Analytical Processing section of this course introduces star schemas, the data cube concept, and OLAP features in relational databases including the Cube and Rollup operators.
The Recursion section of this course covers the SQL standard for queries over recursively-defined relations.","About the Database Series of Courses
""Databases"" was one of Stanford's three inaugural massive open online courses in the fall of 2011. It has been offered in synchronous and then in self-paced versions on a variety of platforms continuously since 2011. The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. 
Relational Databases and SQL is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.
All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.
Why Learn About Databases
Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.",0,1,1,0,0.0,$50,English,English,Edx,Stanford University,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/798930ae-2d16-45f2-8306-734fc7f5a22b-0d7af0d752c8.small.png

Our overall approach is to center our algorithms on the concept of distance. To this end, you will first tackle the ideas of distance and orthogonality in a vector space. You will then apply orthogonality to identify the point within a subspace that is nearest to a point outside of it. This has a central role in the understanding of solutions to inconsistent systems. By taking the subspace to be the column space of a matrix, you will develop a method for producing approximate (“least-squares”) solutions for inconsistent systems. 
You will then explore another application of orthogonal projections: creating a matrix factorization widely used in practical applications of linear algebra. The remaining sections examine some of the many least-squares problems that arise in applications, including the least squares procedure with more general polynomials and functions.

This course traces how the remarkable concept called energy is the natural way of describing, understanding and unifying these diverse phenomena. The course traces the cascade of energy from sunlight to its final destination in a thermal form, considering differential surface heating, the role of convection and buoyancy and the formation of the Earth’s circulation system, and the links to the ocean circulation system. We consider the curvature and rotation of the Earth as key constraints on a system driven by sunlight and energy transformations.

How much time will the course take?
Obviously the answer will depend on your background and motivation to master the course material. Each week will consist of 5 or 6 segments that will each take 5 to 10 minutes to watch or listen to once. There will be some exploratory questions for each lesson and a confirmation quiz for each week. There will be one exploratory activity for each week. The average commitment will be 2-3 hours per week with perhaps 20 hours required for the whole course.
What background does the course assume?
We’ll ask you to pull out a calculator from time to time (but not all the time!) simply as this will help you really master the key ideas. The key thing is to have a curiosity and interest in what makes our planet tick!
What kind of learning activities will the course involve?
The activities are designed to use basic household objects, and our own senses, to engage with observations of the world, and to think about what these mean and lead to. We’ll get you to sense how cold or warm different objects get when left in the sun, and to observe how energy explains things we see and hear.
What difference will the course make to my life?
The course has the conviction that it is hard to care for or value things that we don’t appreciate or have never considered. Although harsh in certain places and times, the Earth’s surface is remarkably habitable. Many forms of life can make their way in many kinds of terrain and climate. What produces these conditions? How are they maintained? We will seek to answer those questions in rudimentary form at least.
What conversations will the course help to perform? 
Courses often imagine a context in which the course material is discussed, and this one is no different. It imagines a setting with family or friends where you might have just learned of a news event involving a storm like a hurricane or thunderstorm, or where a community might have experienced a flood or a drought, or merely unusual weather. You might have heard of El Nino or climate change in the news. This course will give you a background to better engage in a conversation about these great matters, and offer a better sense of the complexity, challenge and wonder connected to living on the surface of such an energetic planet.",0,0,1,0,0.0,,English,English,Edx,University of Toronto,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/8313e86f-a3e7-4c23-bb4e-a09b02690a69-94007b1b6824.small.jpg

Among the topics covered are an introduction to Penetration Testing Methodologies, Recognisance, and Enumeration for Penetration Testers, Scanning, and Vulnerability Enumeration. The class starts with an overview of penetration testing and the phases of a penetration test. The 1st phase is Scoping. In the scoping stage, the students learn to outline the test's logistics, expectations, legal implications, objectives, and goals.
The next phase of the penetration tests is reconnaissance. Reconnaissance or Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering is an essential first step in penetration testing. A penetration tester works on gathering as much intelligence on the target organization and the potential system targets for exploitation.
Students will gain hands-on experience scanning for targets and vulnerabilities. The class concludes with threat modeling and vulnerability identification. During the threat modeling and vulnerability identification phase, the tester identifies targets and maps the attack vectors. Any information gathered during the Reconnaissance phase is used to inform the attack method during the penetration test.

Among the topics covered are foundations of explorations, application debugging, reverse engineering, exploitation development, and web application exploitation. In this class, students learn the third phase of penetration testing; exploitation. In the exploitation phase, the penetration testers try to exploit security weaknesses actively. Exploits are developed to, for example, gather sensitive information or to enable the ethical hacker to compromise a system and manifest themselves on it. Once a device is successfully compromised, it is quite often possible to penetrate more systems because the malicious users now have access to more potential targets that were not available before. The additional marks are accessible because the compromised system can interact with internal devices that are not accessible from the Internet. For any new targets, the reconnaissance and enumeration phases are re-entered, to gather information about these new systems and exploit them.

In addition to the Verified Certificate for the course, the registration fee includes two hundred hours of user access to the Design Center, for verified learners to work online with the industry-standard software and library to create an integrated photonics circuit design project. Because of this special inclusion, financial aid or other discounts will not be available for this course.

Photonics Integrated Circuits (PICs) are analogs to the computer microprocessor chip, poised to partner light-manipulating optical devices and transistor-based electronics for a vast array of modern applications in cloud computing, high-speed mobile wireless, smart sensing, augmented imaging, and quantum communications. PIC circuits create, guide, sort, and read information as signals of light, routed through a dizzying maze of hundreds of devices packed in an area about a millimeter on its side.
How can you design a circuit brimming with so much device density and interconnectedness, all by yourself? How can you do this design reliably, time and time again? How do you ensure your circuit is consistent with the design of others, so that you can both interpret each other’s chip architectures and applications?
Welcome to fabless photonics, the new paradigm for designing high-fidelity PICs.
This course introduces you to PIC design using a standardized Process Design Kit (PDK) library as your builders’ rulebook, and Electronic Photonic Design Automation (EPDA) software as your architecture tools. You’ll be guided through a step-by-step sequence giving you mastery to

model silicon photonic devices;
simulate a PIC;
layout the PIC chip; and
Design Rule Check (DRC) to revise layout into a final blueprint for PIC fabrication.

The course concludes with the creation of a verified “tape-out” design blueprint, ready for potential submission to a Multi-Project Wafer run at the AIM Photonics Institute—the world’s leading 300mm fabrication facility for high performance silicon PICs.
The course is structured around the design of a basic transceiver, and starts off with an overview of fabless PIC design followed by a review of passive photonic devices (waveguides, bends, splitters/combiners, interferometers). You’re then walked through the process of designing the transceiver chip with a focus on two active devices (electro-optic modulator, photodetector). The course highlights device compact models as the PDK methodology for flexible simulation and layout of PIC chip designs, and rigorously trains you in EPDA industry-standard software.
The course runs for an initial three weeks of instruction (self-paced video lectures, homework, design project milestones, and a weekly synchronous webinar); followed by a one-week hiatus during which verified learners continue to have cloud access to the Design Center; continues with three more weeks of instruction; and concludes with one week focused solely on final project design. Verified learners may elect to create a nominal PIC circuit design project in tandem with course instruction; or propose their own original circuit design (compatible with the AIM Education PDK component library), subject to instructor approval.

Confidence intervals are encountered in everyday life, and allow us to make probabilistic statements such as: “Based on the sample of observations we conducted, we are 95% sure that the unknown mean lies between A and B,” and “We are 95% sure that Candidate Smith’s popularity is 52% +/- 3%.” We begin the course by discussing what a confidence interval is and how it is used. We then formulate and interpret confidence intervals for a variety of probability distributions and their parameters.
Hypothesis testing allows us to pose hypotheses and test their validity in a statistically rigorous way. For instance, “Does a new drug result in a higher cure rate than the old drug?” or “Is the mean tensile strength of item A greater than that of item B?” The second half the course begins by motivating hypothesis tests and how they are used. We then discuss the types of errors that can occur with hypothesis testing, and how to design tests to mitigate those errors. Finally, we formulate and interpret hypothesis tests for a variety of probability distributions and their parameters.",1,1,1,0,0.0,$199,English,English,Edx,The Georgia Institute of Technology,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/73025dd6-fea0-48d7-b88a-2f47975678e1-74c1f829cba0.small.jpeg

You’ll learn to write computational procedures using data structures and control-flow statements to automate the production of 3D models.
During the course, you will learn a range of computational methods. These include general programming constructs such as using ‘while’ loops, ‘for-each’ loops, ‘if-else’ conditions, as well as writing your own custom functions. In addition, you will also learn to use two key data structures: list and dictionaries. And in the process, you will become familiar with the programming process: writing code, executing code and debugging code.
When creating modelling procedures, you will use a range of different modelling functions. You will also learn how geometric models can be augmented with an additional layer of semantic data. You will learn how geometric entities can be tagged with additional attribute values, and how these attributes can then be used for querying your models. You will also learn how to add attributes to define colour, materials, and other visual properties.
During this course, you will use Möbius Modeller, the modelling tool that is used throughout this “Spatial Computational Thinking” module. It is free and easy to use browser-based software to write algorithms for automatic generation and visualization of complex models with spatial information.

Railway Engineering: An Integral Approach,https://www.edx.org/course/railway-engineering-an-integral-approach-2,Engineering,"Discover the science and complexity of railway systems, including how their efficiency depends on the alignment of all their components.","Have you ever wondered what it takes to get your train on the right platform at the scheduled time every day?
Journey with us into the world of rail - a complex system that connects people, cities and countries.
Railway systems entail much more than a train and a track. They are based on advanced technical and operational solutions, dealing with continuously changing demands for more efficient transport for both passengers and freight every day. Each system consists of many components that must be properly integrated: from trains, tracks, stations, signaling and control systems, through monitoring, maintenance and the impact on cities, landscape and people. This integration is the big challenge and the source of many train delays, inconvenient connections and other issues that impact our society.
This engineering course attempts to tackle those issues by introducing you to a holistic approach to railway systems engineering. You will learn how the system components depend on each other to create a reliable, efficient and state-of-the-art network.
We will address questions such as:

How do railways work and how did they evolve over time?
How do different components of the railway system interact?
What is the effect of railways from an urban, social and economic point of view?
What can be done to improve the monitoring and maintenance of tracks?
How are timetables designed in a way that balances passenger demand with the capacity of the railway and is adaptable to handle unexpected disturbances?
How to prevent and deal with disturbances caused by external factors?
How does the design of railways influence their performance over time?

A new serious game has been designed for this course to guide you through the process of decision making while building a rail network and maintaining it. Cities have to be connected in an ever-changing setting, dealing with wear, capacity, developments and disturbances. How will your choices affect the performance of the system?
This first ever MOOC on railway systems engineering is delivered by the renowned experts of TU Delft and leading professionals working in the industry. It combines theoretical knowledge with practical examples, with the main objective to maintain a high degree of reliability under predictable and unknown circumstances.

Real-Time Bluetooth Networks - Shape the World,https://www.edx.org/course/real-time-bluetooth-networks-shape-the-world,"Computer Science, Engineering",Learn the design fundamentals of a real-time operating system (RTOS) and how to build a Bluetooth network in this hands-on project-based course.,"The increased demand by consumers and businesses for more utility, connectivity and smarter and more efficient electronic technology not only creates a need for more embedded systems but also for engineers in the embedded systems field.
In this lab-based computer science course, explore the complexities of embedded systems and learn how to develop your own real-time operating system (RTOS) by building a personal fitness device with Bluetooth connectivity (BLE). An operating system (OS) is a software system that computers use to manage the resources of a computer. The OS decides which tasks are performed when and decides how resources are utilized. Simple embedded systems, which are a combination of electrical, mechanical, chemical, and computer components designed to perform a dedicated function, originally did not need an OS. However, as embedded systems have evolved, so have their complexities. To manage this, an RTOS is now required.
Embedded systems are often deployed in safety-critical situations such as automotive, military, industrial, and medical applications. In applications such as communications and consumer electronics, response time and processing speed are important. A real-time system not only needs to arrive at the correct answer, but must also get the correct answer at the correct time. A RTOS manages a computer's resources so that tasks are performed in a timely mannner.
In this computer science course, students will learn the design fundamentals of an RTOS from the bottom up and use these fundamentals to build practical real-time applications. We will provide a board support package (BSP), so students will be able to focus on the RTOS and Bluetooth network without needing prior experience in circuits and I/O device driver software. This is a hands-on project-based lab course , where you will incrementally build a personal fitness device with Bluetooth connectivity.
This course is intended for students and professional engineers wishing to improve their skills in the fields of embedded systems, product development, computer architecture, operating systems, and Bluetooth networks.

Robotics foundations are dealt with in this two-part course. The second part covers planning and control. Suitable interpolation techniques are presented to plan trajectories in either joint or operational space. For controlling a robot in the free space, motion control strategies can be either decentralized or centralized. The former leads to independent joint control which treats nonlinear dynamic couplings as disturbance, while the latter is based on the robot dynamic model. PD control with gravity compensation and inverse dynamics control are presented. Operational space control is then introduced as a premise to controlling a robot interacting with the environment. Both indirect and direct force control schemes are developed for constrained motion control. The visual servoing approach is adopted to integrate information about the objects present in the scene into the control loop, where the resulting schemes can be of three types: position-based, image-based, or hybrid.

Selected Topics on Discrete Choice,https://www.edx.org/course/selected-topics-on-discrete-choice,Engineering,"Discrete choice models are used extensively in many disciplines where it is important to predict human behavior at a disaggregate level. This course is a follow up of the online course “Introduction to Discrete Choice Models”. We have selected some important advanced topics, that are presented in detail.","The logit model is the workhorse of choice modelers. But it has some limitations. In particular, some assumptions used to derive it may not be consistent with the behavioral reality. It may lead to erroneous forecast. We illustrated using the so-called ""red bud-blue bus"" paradox, and Multivariate Extre Value models, addressing some of these issues, are introduced.
The sampling procedure used to collect choice data has a critical impact on the model estimation procedure. We introduce classical sampling procedures, and analyze in details the implications for model estimation. 
In our quest to address the limitations of the logit model, we introduce a new family of models, based on ""mixtures"". We define what mixtures are, how they can be calculated. We investigate several important modeling assumptions that they can cover.
Random utility relies on the rationality assumption for the decision-makers. We show that human beings are not always consistent with this assumption, and may exhibit apparent irrationality. Hybrid choice models are able to capture subjective dimensions of the choice process, using variables that are called ""latent variables"". 
Choices evolve over time. Individuals learn, develop habits. In order to capture that, it is necessary to observe individuals over time, and to collect so-called ""panel data"". The introduction of the time dimension into choice models has some econometrics implications, that we describe in detail. 
Who needs choice models, when machine learning algorithms are so powerful and pervasive? In this last chapter, we introduce the similarities and differences between machine learning and discrete choice, and we discuss some potential limitations of machine learning in the context of the analysis of choice data.",2,1,1,0,0.0,$135,English,English,Edx,École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/7abd5780-b1cd-410e-b8d1-d71ac918b78c-419cb709cd03.small.jpeg

Semantics of First-Order Logic,https://www.edx.org/course/semantics-of-first-order-logic,"Computer Science, Math, Philosophy & Ethics","First-order logic is a restricted, formalized language which is particularly suited to the precise expression of ideas. The language has uses in many disciplines including computer science, mathematics, linguistics and artificial intelligence. 
We will describe how to write sentences in the language, how to determine when a sentence is true in a particular situation, how to recognize important relationships between sentences, and describe some limitations of the language.","The focus of this class is on the language of first-order logic , a formally defined language that allows us to make precise and unambiguous statements about any subject of interest.
Using the language of first-order logic we will investigate many foundational topics in logic. We will address such questions as what counts as a grammatical expression, and the circumstances under which it makes a claim about the world (whether it can be considered true or false, E.g. “the sky is brown”, as compared to “oh, my goodness!”).
For expressions that do make claims — we call these sentences — we can further examine whether they are true or false in particular situations. “Aristotle is alive” is a sentence that was once true, but became false around 2000 years ago, and has remained false ever since.
These questions fall into the study of semantics , or meaning.
Once we understand how sentences can be considered true or false, we can investigate important related questions. Some sentences are always true, that is true in every situation — we call such sentences logical truths. Sentences bear relationships with one another. For example, two sentences might be true in exactly the same situations - they are logically equivalent. We will demonstrate methods for determining when these properties and relationships hold as natural extensions to the semantic theory for first-order logic.
Finally, we will explore the limits of first-order logic. There are some sentences of English that are not expressible in the language, and it is important to know that this is the case, and to understand why it is so. This observation has led logicians to develop yet more powerful languages with more complex semantics. Almost all of these languages are based on the language of first-order logic and knowledge of first-order logic is fundamental to understanding them. So first-order logic is a basic building block for the study of these language and is a great place to begin the journey into the field of logic.",0,1,1,0,0.0,$50,English,English,Edx,Stanford University,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/7e8601c6-c50a-4345-8af9-de4b0072b15c-7856be03d2d1.small.png

The material is now being offered as a set of five self-paced courses, which can be taken in a variety of ways to learn about different aspects of databases. 
Relational Databases and SQL is the most popular course in the Databases series. It is applicable to learners seeking to gain a strong understanding of relational databases, and to master SQL, the long-accepted standard query language for relational database systems. Additional courses focus on advanced concepts in relational databases and SQL, formal foundations and database design methodologies, and semistructured data.
All of the courses are based around video lectures and demos. Many of them include quizzes between video segments to check understanding, in-depth standalone quizzes, and/or a variety of automatically-checked interactive exercises. Each course also includes an unmoderated discussion forum and pointers to readings and resources. The courses are described briefly below. Taught by Professor Jennifer Widom, the overall curriculum draws from Stanford's popular longstanding Databases course.
Why Learn About Databases
Databases are incredibly prevalent -- they underlie technology used by most people every day if not every hour. Databases reside behind a huge number of websites; they're a crucial component of telecommunications systems, banking systems, video games, and just about any other software system or electronic device that maintains some amount of persistent information. In addition to persistence, database systems provide a number of other properties that make them exceptionally useful and convenient: reliability, efficiency, scalability, concurrency control, data abstractions, and high-level query languages. Databases are so ubiquitous and important that computer science graduates frequently cite their database class as the one most useful to them in their industry or graduate-school careers.",0,1,1,0,0.0,$50,English,English,Edx,Stanford University,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/b01ee61e-1ac1-4a07-b5f4-348a4b4868d6-934315464fc2.small.png

Starting with Assembly, C, C++, and moving towards Java, Python, and finally building of backend and frontend frameworks, all of these became popular and were or getting replaced with some other language or framework. Shell programming (scripting) is the only programming language that has been popular and the choice of programmers, testers, system administrators, etc., from 1970 to date (21st century). Even today, all of us rely heavily on shell programming or its variants for our day to day tasks, configuring software environments, and software automation. ****

Structure is crucial to languages. There are several layers of grammatical structure in all languages. We will learn about these and examine how sign languages are structured.
Learning is how children and adults acquire the ability to understand and use a sign language.
Change takes place over time in all languages.

Structure of Materials,https://www.edx.org/course/structure-of-materials,"Chemistry, Engineering, Science",Discover the structure of the materials that make up our modern world and learn how this underlying structure influences the properties and performance of these materials.,"Structure determines so much about a material: its properties, its potential applications, and its performance within those applications. This course from MIT’s Department of Materials Science and Engineering explores the structure of a wide variety of materials with current-day engineering applications. 
The course begins with an introduction to amorphous materials. We explore glasses and polymers, learn about the factors that influence their structure, and learn how materials scientists measure and describe the structure of these materials. 
Then we begin a discussion of the crystalline state, exploring what it means for a material to be crystalline, how we describe directions in a crystal, and how we can determine the structure of crystal through x-ray diffraction. We explore the underlying crystalline structures that underpin so many of the materials that surround us. Finally, we look at how tensors can be used to represent the properties of three-dimensional materials, and we consider how symmetry places constraints on the properties of materials. 
We move on to an exploration of quasi-, plastic, and liquid crystals. Then, we learn about the point defects that are present in all crystals, and we will learn how the presence of these defects lead to diffusion in materials. Next, we will explore dislocations in materials. We will introduce the descriptors that we use to describe dislocations, we will learn about dislocation motion, and will consider how dislocations dramatically affect the strength of materials. Finally, we will explore how defects can be used to strengthen materials, and we will learn about the properties of higher-order defects such as stacking faults and grain boundaries.",1,2,1,0,0.0,$150,English,English,Edx,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,https://prod-discovery.edx-cdn.org/media/course/image/6b42d717-35a0-4b65-90bb-53f97f0e6c49-2700d22842f8.small.jpg

The Challenges of Global Poverty,https://www.edx.org/course/the-challenges-of-global-poverty,"Data Analysis & Statistics, Economics & Finance, Social Sciences",A course for those who are interested in the challenge posed by massive and persistent world poverty.,"This course is part of the MITx MicroMasters program in Data, Economics, and Development Policy (DEDP). To enroll in the MicroMasters track or to learn more about this program and how it integrates with MIT’s Master’s Program in DEDP, please visit the MicroMasters portal.
This is a course for those who are interested in the challenge posed by massive and persistent world poverty, and are hopeful that economists might have something useful to say about this challenge. The questions we will take up include: Is extreme poverty a thing of the past? What is economic life like when living under a dollar per day? Are the poor always hungry? How do we make schools work for poor citizens? How do we deal with the disease burden? Is microfinance invaluable or overrated? Without property rights, is life destined to be ""nasty, brutish and short""? Should we leave economic development to the market? Should we leave economic development to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Does foreign aid help or hinder? Where is the best place to intervene? And many others.
At the end of this course, you should have a good sense of the key questions asked by scholars interested in poverty today, and hopefully a few answers as well.

More specifically we’ll:

Learn about funicular forms and how ropes and cables resist tension.
Discuss how columns, arches, and anti-funicular forms resist compression.
Discover how trusses, beams and walls resist loads. • Sketch the flow of forces through structures.
Compare and contrast different structural forms and systems to answer a range of questions such as: Why might an engineer choose a beam over a truss? How do the dimensions of a structure affect its response? How do engineers choose forms and systems to create structures that are both elegant and functional?

This course is centered on the concept of the transfer function of a system. Also called the system function, the transfer function completely describes the response of a system to any input signal in a highly conceptual manner. This visualization occurs not in the time domain, where we normally observe behavior of systems, but rather in the “frequency domain.” We need a device for moving from the time domain to the frequency domain; this is the Laplace transform.

How well tests tell us if an aquifer can provide enough water?
How can we use wells to dewater construction sites?","Groundwater is the water beneath the ground surface. It is a vast freshwater reservoir often overlooked because invisible, yet 1000 times greater than all lakes and rivers. The Earth is blue for its oceans, but green for the freshwater under our feet. Half of the world’s population rely on groundwater for drinking and almost half of the irrigated land now depends on groundwater, a ten-fold increase in the past 50 years. In order to use the water from the ground, we first have to extract it! This course introduces wells hydraulics. Wells are used to provide groundwater for domestic, agricultural or industrial uses. Wells are also used in applications to control groundwater flow and contamination. Pump and treat systems are designed to extract contaminated water before it can be treated. The treated water is released to the environment, sometimes using recharge wells that can replenish aquifers. Wells can also control salt intrusions in coastal environments or the water table level at a construction site. 
This course addresses questions such as:

How exactly do we extract groundwater? 
How do we know if an aquifer can provide enough water?
How do we model underground flow to wells?
How can we use wells to remove water from construction sites or water-logged fields?

This wells hydraulics course starts with a description of steady flow to wells. We introduce the notion of radial coordinates and steady flow to wells in confined and unconfined aquifers. We also introduce finite difference methods to model flow to wells. We introduce transient flows in confined, semiconfined and unconfined aquifers. We use graphic methods and semi-automated methods to calculate aquifer properties from well tests. We also introduce slug tests and their analysis. 
After the well and slug tests, we introduce well fields and issues of dewatering. We review the superposition principle and problems of domain boundaries before focusing on dewatering examples. We continue to explore the topic of well fields in the context of extraction and injection wells, with an example of pump and treat design and an in-situ remediation design.
